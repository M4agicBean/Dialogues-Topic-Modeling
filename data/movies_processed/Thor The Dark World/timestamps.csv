"Long before the birth of light,there was darkness.","00:00:34,034 "," 00:00:38,621"
And from that darknesscame the Dark Elves.,"00:00:38,789 "," 00:00:42,834"
"Millennia ago,the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith","00:00:44,712 "," 00:00:48,423"
sought to transform our universeback into one of eternal night.,"00:00:48,590 "," 00:00:53,428"
"Such evil was possiblethrough the power of the Aether,","00:00:55,889 "," 00:01:00,601"
an ancient force of infinite destruction.,"00:01:00,811 "," 00:01:04,480"
Malekith.,"00:01:07,651 "," 00:01:08,776"
Asgard's forces are upon us.,"00:01:08,944 "," 00:01:10,653"
"The noble armies of Asgard,led by my father, King Bor,","00:01:19,079 "," 00:01:23,374"
waged a mighty waragainst these creatures.,"00:01:23,500 "," 00:01:26,419"
Send in the Kursed!,"00:01:37,389 "," 00:01:39,682"
"As the Nine Worldsconverged above him,","00:01:56,492 "," 00:01:59,285"
Malekith could at lastunleash the Aether.,"00:01:59,369 "," 00:02:03,831"
Ahh!,"00:02:18,055 "," 00:02:19,138"
But Asgard rippedthe weapon from his grasp.,"00:02:21,975 "," 00:02:25,228"
"Without it, the Dark Elves fell.","00:02:26,271 "," 00:02:28,439"
"With the battle all but lost,","00:02:43,330 "," 00:02:44,914"
Malekith sacrificed his own people,"00:02:45,207 "," 00:02:47,583"
in a desperate attemptto lay waste to Asgard's army.,"00:02:48,418 "," 00:02:52,463"
Their deaths will mean our survival.,"00:02:55,300 "," 00:02:57,635"
This war is far from over.,"00:02:59,096 "," 00:03:01,097"
"Malekith was vanquished,and the Aether was no more.","00:03:08,730 "," 00:03:14,318"
Or so we were led to believe.,"00:03:15,362 "," 00:03:17,238"
"Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?","00:03:18,699 "," 00:03:22,034"
If only we could.,"00:03:22,703 "," 00:03:25,079"
But its power is too great.,"00:03:25,247 "," 00:03:27,081"
Bury it deep.,"00:03:27,791 "," 00:03:30,167"
Somewhere no one will ever find it.,"00:03:30,544 "," 00:03:32,712"
Loki.,"00:04:14,504 "," 00:04:15,546"
"Hello, Mother.","00:04:16,048 "," 00:04:17,256"
Have I made you proud?,"00:04:18,091 "," 00:04:19,634"
"Please, don't make this worse.","00:04:19,801 "," 00:04:22,178"
Define worse.,"00:04:22,512 "," 00:04:24,096"
Enough!,"00:04:24,264 "," 00:04:25,848"
I will speak to the prisoner alone.,"00:04:26,016 "," 00:04:28,309"
I really don't seewhat all the fuss is about.,"00:04:42,366 "," 00:04:44,700"
Do you not truly feelthe gravity of your crimes?,"00:04:44,868 "," 00:04:48,245"
"Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,","00:04:48,372 "," 00:04:51,207"
and death.,"00:04:51,875 "," 00:04:53,376"
I went down to Midgard to rule thepeople of Earth as a benevolent god.,"00:04:53,543 "," 00:04:57,755"
Just like you.,"00:04:58,632 "," 00:05:00,091"
"We are not gods.We are born, we live, we die.","00:05:00,425 "," 00:05:04,053"
Just as humans do.,"00:05:04,429 "," 00:05:06,597"
"Give or take 5,000 years.","00:05:07,557 "," 00:05:09,934"
All this because Loki desires a throne.,"00:05:10,102 "," 00:05:13,854"
It is my birthright.,"00:05:14,022 "," 00:05:15,356"
Your birthright was to die,"00:05:15,524 "," 00:05:18,859"
as a child.,"00:05:19,361 "," 00:05:20,903"
Cast out onto a frozen rock.,"00:05:22,030 "," 00:05:24,490"
"If I had not taken you in,","00:05:26,410 "," 00:05:28,619"
you would not be here now to hate me.,"00:05:28,787 "," 00:05:31,414"
"If I am for the axe,then for mercy's sake,","00:05:31,623 "," 00:05:33,708"
just swing it.,"00:05:33,792 "," 00:05:36,293"
"It's not that I don't love our little talks,","00:05:36,837 "," 00:05:38,504"
it's just...,"00:05:38,672 "," 00:05:40,589"
I don't love them.,"00:05:41,675 "," 00:05:43,342"

and you will never see her again.,"00:05:45,762 "," 00:05:47,179"
You will spend the rest of your daysin the dungeons.,"00:05:48,098 "," 00:05:52,393"
And what of Thor?,"00:05:55,522 "," 00:05:57,648"
You'll make that witless oaf kingwhile I rot in chains.,"00:05:58,275 "," 00:06:01,861"
Thor must strive to undothe damage you have done.,"00:06:02,029 "," 00:06:05,531"
He will bring order to the Nine Realms,"00:06:05,699 "," 00:06:07,199"
"and then, yes...","00:06:07,367 "," 00:06:09,326"
He will be king.,"00:06:10,245 "," 00:06:12,163"
Ah!,"00:06:21,882 "," 00:06:23,007"
I've got this completely under control!,"00:06:59,544 "," 00:07:01,253"
Is that why everything is on fire?,"00:07:01,421 "," 00:07:03,464"
Ah!,"00:07:18,438 "," 00:07:19,438"
You're welcome.,"00:07:27,489 "," 00:07:29,031"

I accept your surrender.,"00:08:18,748 "," 00:08:20,291"
Anyone else?,"00:08:33,180 "," 00:08:34,513"
Perhaps next timewe should start with the big one.,"00:08:42,397 "," 00:08:45,941"
Keep moving. Come on!,"00:08:46,985 "," 00:08:49,153"
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.Don't you turn around!,"00:09:00,624 "," 00:09:03,083"
Where do we go next?,"00:09:04,127 "," 00:09:05,878"
"Hogun, the peaceis nearly won across the Nine Realms.","00:09:06,046 "," 00:09:10,007"
"You should stay here. Be withyour people, where your heart is.","00:09:11,134 "," 00:09:13,677"

You have my thanks.,"00:09:16,848 "," 00:09:18,807"
As you have mine.,"00:09:19,601 "," 00:09:21,644"
"Heimdall, when you're ready.","00:09:25,857 "," 00:09:27,441"
Is Vanaheim secure?,"00:10:12,445 "," 00:10:14,363"
As are Nornheim and Ria.,"00:10:14,531 "," 00:10:15,990"
Though our work would have gonemore quickly with you at the fore.,"00:10:16,241 "," 00:10:18,492"
You must think I'm a piece of breadthat needs to be buttered so heavily.,"00:10:19,577 "," 00:10:23,872"
That was not my intent.,"00:10:24,249 "," 00:10:26,125"
"For the first timesince Bifrost was destroyed,","00:10:26,418 "," 00:10:28,627"
the Nine Realms are at peace.,"00:10:28,712 "," 00:10:30,504"
They're well reminded of our strength,"00:10:30,672 "," 00:10:33,090"

Thank you.,"00:10:37,971 "," 00:10:39,096"

except your confusedand distracted heart.,"00:10:41,975 "," 00:10:45,019"
"This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.","00:10:45,186 "," 00:10:47,438"
"Human lives are fleeting,they're nothing.","00:10:47,856 "," 00:10:49,148"
You'd be better servedby what lies in front of you.,"00:10:49,649 "," 00:10:51,567"
"I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,","00:10:54,612 "," 00:10:56,030"
but as your father.,"00:10:56,114 "," 00:10:57,156"
You are ready.,"00:10:57,240 "," 00:10:58,240"
The time has comefor you to take the throne.,"00:10:58,575 "," 00:11:00,367"

Another!,"00:11:55,215 "," 00:11:56,548"
There was a timewhen you would celebrate for weeks.,"00:12:12,857 "," 00:12:15,859"
I remember you celebratedthe Battle of Harokin,"00:12:17,195 "," 00:12:20,280"
so much that you nearlystarted the second.,"00:12:20,407 "," 00:12:22,658"
"Well, the first was so much fun.","00:12:23,326 "," 00:12:25,327"
Take a drink with me.,"00:12:31,793 "," 00:12:33,836"
"Surely, the Allfather could haveno further task for you tonight.","00:12:33,962 "," 00:12:37,005"
"No, this is one I set myself.","00:12:37,173 "," 00:12:39,007"
It does not go unnoticedthat you disappear each night.,"00:12:40,760 "," 00:12:44,054"
There are nine realms.,"00:12:44,431 "," 00:12:46,432"
The future king of Asgardmust focus on more than one.,"00:12:46,599 "," 00:12:49,560"
I thank you for your sword,"00:12:54,649 "," 00:12:56,400"
"and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.","00:12:56,484 "," 00:12:59,611"
Hi.,"00:13:20,091 "," 00:13:23,427"
"So, what's the story with you?","00:13:23,720 "," 00:13:24,887"
Why does there have to be a story?There's no story.,"00:13:25,597 "," 00:13:27,556"
You spent the firstten minutes of our date,"00:13:27,724 "," 00:13:29,975"
hiding behind a menuthat has three choices on it.,"00:13:30,059 "," 00:13:32,019"
"It's either chicken,vegetarian, or fish, Jane.","00:13:32,604 "," 00:13:34,521"
I think there's a story,"00:13:34,898 "," 00:13:36,732"
and I'm thinkingthe story involves a guy.,"00:13:36,900 "," 00:13:40,068"
It's complicated.,"00:13:40,737 "," 00:13:42,070"
Is he still around?,"00:13:42,238 "," 00:13:43,405"
"No, he...","00:13:43,615 "," 00:13:45,532"
Went away.,"00:13:46,034 "," 00:13:47,201"
I've been there.,"00:13:47,368 "," 00:13:48,744"
"The going away. It's hard, isn't it?","00:13:48,912 "," 00:13:50,954"
I was seeing a woman,"00:13:51,247 "," 00:13:52,456"
and she took a job in New York.,"00:13:52,749 "," 00:13:54,416"
"Eventually, the distance killed it.","00:13:55,084 "," 00:13:56,877"
And the factthat she kept sleeping with other dudes.,"00:13:57,086 "," 00:14:00,422"
" No! Oh, so many.","00:14:00,590 "," 00:14:02,174"
"Hi. Could we get some wine, please?","00:14:03,593 "," 00:14:06,345"
"Sure, I'd love some.","00:14:06,513 "," 00:14:07,554"
"Richard, this is Darcy.","00:14:07,680 "," 00:14:09,264"
What are you doing here?,"00:14:10,308 "," 00:14:11,767"
Oh. Hello.,"00:14:13,978 "," 00:14:14,978"
"So, I show up to workat the lab/your mom's house,","00:14:15,230 "," 00:14:18,815"
"fully expecting youto be moping around in your pajamas,","00:14:18,942 "," 00:14:22,653"
eating ice cream and obsessing about...,"00:14:22,779 "," 00:14:24,488"
You know who.,"00:14:24,656 "," 00:14:25,656"
Ah.,"00:14:25,823 "," 00:14:26,865"
But you're not.You're wearing lady clothes.,"00:14:26,991 "," 00:14:29,409"
"You even showered, didn't you?You smell good.","00:14:29,536 "," 00:14:31,119"
Is there a point to all this?,"00:14:31,246 "," 00:14:32,246"
Because there really needsto be a point to all this.,"00:14:32,330 "," 00:14:34,331"
Right.,"00:14:34,457 "," 00:14:35,666"
You know all that scientific equipmentyou don't look at anymore?,"00:14:36,209 "," 00:14:38,377"
You might wantto start looking at it again.,"00:14:39,295 "," 00:14:41,255"
This is the reasonwe came all the way out here.,"00:14:41,381 "," 00:14:43,423"
It's malfunctioning.,"00:14:43,550 "," 00:14:44,550"
That's what I said.,"00:14:44,634 "," 00:14:45,634"
That's what I did.,"00:14:47,178 "," 00:14:48,595"
I thought you would do somethinga little more scientific.,"00:14:48,680 "," 00:14:50,639"
" I'm sure it's nothing. Yeah, it's...","00:14:50,807 "," 00:14:52,349"
It doesn't look like nothing.,"00:14:52,433 "," 00:14:53,600"
It kind of looks like the readingsthat Erik was rambling about.,"00:14:53,726 "," 00:14:55,936"
Our friend Erik,"00:14:56,271 "," 00:14:57,354"
kind of went banana balls.,"00:14:57,981 "," 00:14:59,481"
He's not interested.,"00:14:59,607 "," 00:15:00,566"
 I'm not interested. I'm interested.,"00:15:00,650 "," 00:15:01,650"
It's time for you to go now.,"00:15:01,901 "," 00:15:03,318"
Okay.,"00:15:04,696 "," 00:15:05,779"
Short but sweet.,"00:15:08,992 "," 00:15:10,158"
She needs help.,"00:15:10,243 "," 00:15:11,952"
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.,"00:15:15,331 "," 00:15:17,165"
"Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.","00:15:17,333 "," 00:15:19,209"
"Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.","00:15:20,253 "," 00:15:24,673"
Sea bass...,"00:15:24,841 "," 00:15:27,301"
Sea bass.,"00:15:28,595 "," 00:15:29,595"
Jane?,"00:15:29,679 "," 00:15:31,096"
Maybe you should stopsaying sea bass,"00:15:31,180 "," 00:15:32,764"
and go after your friend.,"00:15:32,849 "," 00:15:33,890"
This was so fun.,"00:15:34,892 "," 00:15:36,018"
I'll just stay hereand say sea bass alone.,"00:15:37,020 "," 00:15:38,937"
And I hate you.,"00:15:46,821 "," 00:15:47,821"

Thanks.,"00:18:05,543 "," 00:18:06,626"
We just found it.,"00:18:06,753 "," 00:18:08,420"
Can you show us?,"00:18:10,631 "," 00:18:11,840"
That doesn't seem right.,"00:18:38,326 "," 00:18:40,827"
Where'd it go?,"00:18:57,720 "," 00:18:58,887"
That's...,"00:19:12,443 "," 00:19:13,443"
That's incredible!,"00:19:14,028 "," 00:19:15,111"

Sometimes they come back.,"00:19:30,419 "," 00:19:31,795"
Sometimes they don't.,"00:19:32,088 "," 00:19:33,505"
I want to throw something!,"00:19:36,259 "," 00:19:37,676"
"Jane, give me your shoe.","00:19:37,802 "," 00:19:38,927"
I haven't seen readings like this since...,"00:19:41,430 "," 00:19:43,723"
Since...,"00:19:44,350 "," 00:19:45,350"
New Mexico?,"00:19:45,476 "," 00:19:46,476"

The Aether awakens us.,"00:23:00,546 "," 00:23:02,797"
The Convergence returns.,"00:23:02,965 "," 00:23:06,426"
You're late.,"00:23:21,150 "," 00:23:22,817"
Merriment can sometimesbe a heavier burden than battle.,"00:23:23,903 "," 00:23:27,155"
Then you're doingone of them incorrectly.,"00:23:27,323 "," 00:23:28,823"
Perhaps.,"00:23:29,742 "," 00:23:31,659"
How fare the stars?,"00:23:31,827 "," 00:23:33,661"
Still shining.,"00:23:33,829 "," 00:23:35,497"

The universe hasn't seen this marvelsince before my watch began.,"00:23:51,972 "," 00:23:55,850"
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.,"00:23:56,894 "," 00:24:00,105"
"But while its effects can be dangerous,","00:24:01,524 "," 00:24:04,067"
it is truly beautiful.,"00:24:04,902 "," 00:24:07,737"
I see nothing.,"00:24:09,031 "," 00:24:10,490"
"Or, perhaps,that is not the beauty you seek.","00:24:10,574 "," 00:24:14,202"
How is she?,"00:24:20,042 "," 00:24:21,376"
"She's quite clever,your mortal.","00:24:21,544 "," 00:24:23,461"

Tell me you didn't call the police.,"00:25:20,436 "," 00:25:21,853"

 Not call the police. I was freaking out.,"00:25:23,189 "," 00:25:24,981"
"You call the cops, they call the Feds.","00:25:25,065 "," 00:25:26,274"

We had unimpeded access.,"00:25:32,198 "," 00:25:33,489"
Our only competition was 10 years old!,"00:25:33,824 "," 00:25:36,117"
Jane! You were gone for 5 hours.,"00:25:36,285 "," 00:25:37,827"
What?,"00:25:38,370 "," 00:25:39,621"
That's weird.,"00:25:46,462 "," 00:25:48,129"
Typical.,"00:26:09,693 "," 00:26:11,110"

Sorry. I just neededto make sure you were real.,"00:26:15,574 "," 00:26:18,326"
It's been a very strange day.,"00:26:18,494 "," 00:26:19,994"
"I am. Jane, what...","00:26:20,162 "," 00:26:21,663"
Where were you?,"00:26:22,081 "," 00:26:24,332"
Heimdall cannot see you.,"00:26:25,251 "," 00:26:26,584"
I was right here where you left me.,"00:26:26,752 "," 00:26:28,503"
"I was waiting, and then I was crying","00:26:28,754 "," 00:26:30,838"

"Wars were raging,marauders were pillaging.","00:26:38,555 "," 00:26:40,723"
I had to put an end to the slaughter.,"00:26:41,267 "," 00:26:42,892"
"As excuses go, it's not terrible.","00:26:44,478 "," 00:26:48,231"
But I saw you on TV.You were in New York!,"00:26:48,315 "," 00:26:51,150"
"Jane, I fought to protect youfrom the dangers of my world","00:26:52,069 "," 00:26:54,779"

Odin continues tobring me new friends.,"00:35:04,019 "," 00:35:07,688"
How thoughtful.,"00:35:08,064 "," 00:35:09,815"
"The books I sent,do they not interest you?","00:35:10,066 "," 00:35:13,527"
Is that how I am to while away eternity?Reading?,"00:35:14,029 "," 00:35:17,323"
"I've done everything in my powerto make you comfortable, Loki.","00:35:17,407 "," 00:35:20,534"
Have you?,"00:35:20,619 "," 00:35:21,660"
Does Odin share your concern?,"00:35:22,704 "," 00:35:24,538"
Does Thor?,"00:35:25,999 "," 00:35:27,541"
"It must be so inconvenient,them asking after me day and night.","00:35:27,709 "," 00:35:31,337"
You know full well it was your actionsthat brought you here.,"00:35:31,421 "," 00:35:34,548"
My actions?,"00:35:35,091 "," 00:35:36,425"
I was merely giving truth to the liethat I had been fed my entire life...,"00:35:36,593 "," 00:35:39,845"
That I was born to be a king.,"00:35:39,930 "," 00:35:41,597"
A king?,"00:35:41,681 "," 00:35:43,641"
A true king admits his faults.,"00:35:43,725 "," 00:35:45,726"
What of the lives you took on Earth?,"00:35:45,852 "," 00:35:47,269"
A mere handfulcompared to the number,"00:35:47,437 "," 00:35:49,021"
that Odin has taken himself.,"00:35:49,105 "," 00:35:50,898"
 Your father... He's not my father!,"00:35:51,066 "," 00:35:53,734"
Then am I not your mother?,"00:35:56,613 "," 00:35:58,823"
You're not.,"00:36:04,037 "," 00:36:05,996"
You're always so perceptiveabout everyone but yourself.,"00:36:09,793 "," 00:36:14,755"
"When you came for me,you knew I was in trouble.","00:36:29,938 "," 00:36:33,107"
Heimdall had lost sight of you.,"00:36:33,233 "," 00:36:34,483"
You were no longer on Earth.,"00:36:34,609 "," 00:36:36,277"
How is that possible?,"00:36:36,444 "," 00:36:37,736"
I believe you were and you weren't.,"00:36:37,946 "," 00:36:39,905"
The Nine Realmstravel within Yggdrasil,"00:36:39,990 "," 00:36:42,867"
orbiting Midgard much the wayyour planets orbit the sun.,"00:36:43,159 "," 00:36:46,412"
"And every 5,000 years,the worlds align perfectly","00:36:46,580 "," 00:36:50,708"
and we call this the Convergence.,"00:36:50,792 "," 00:36:53,002"
"During this time, the bordersbetween worlds become blurred.","00:36:55,130 "," 00:36:58,799"
It's possibleyou found one of these points.,"00:36:59,467 "," 00:37:02,261"
We are lucky that it remained open.,"00:37:04,306 "," 00:37:06,515"
Once the worlds pass out of alignment,"00:37:06,683 "," 00:37:10,936"
then the connection is lost.,"00:37:12,355 "," 00:37:14,398"
I like the way you explain things.,"00:37:27,162 "," 00:37:29,538"
What's going to happen to me?,"00:37:31,833 "," 00:37:33,208"
"I'll find a way to save you, Jane.","00:37:33,376 "," 00:37:34,960"
 Your father said there was... My father doesn't know everything.,"00:37:35,128 "," 00:37:38,297"
Don't let him hear you say that.,"00:37:38,506 "," 00:37:40,174"
Jane Foster...,"00:37:41,551 "," 00:37:42,843"
"Please meet Frigga,","00:37:42,928 "," 00:37:44,261"
"Queen of Asgard, and my mother.","00:37:44,346 "," 00:37:46,263"
Hi.,"00:37:49,017 "," 00:37:50,476"
Move!,"00:38:39,609 "," 00:38:41,026"
To the dungeons!,"00:39:27,615 "," 00:39:28,866"
Come on!,"00:39:29,242 "," 00:39:30,242"
You might want to takethe stairs to the left.,"00:39:54,059 "," 00:39:56,477"
The prisons.,"00:40:07,530 "," 00:40:08,864"
 Loki... Go.,"00:40:09,032 "," 00:40:10,824"
I will look after her.,"00:40:10,992 "," 00:40:12,826"
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!,"00:40:24,255 "," 00:40:25,798"
There's no pleasing some creatures.,"00:40:29,844 "," 00:40:32,679"
"Return to your cells,no further harm will come to you.","00:40:40,688 "," 00:40:42,815"
You have my word.,"00:40:43,024 "," 00:40:44,191"
"Very well, you do not have my word.","00:40:46,027 "," 00:40:48,362"
Send a squadronto the weapons vault.,"00:40:58,248 "," 00:41:00,249"
Defend it at all costs.Secure the dungeon.,"00:41:00,375 "," 00:41:02,918"
 Odin. Frigga.,"00:41:03,086 "," 00:41:04,670"
Go!,"00:41:05,547 "," 00:41:06,547"
It's a skirmish.,"00:41:07,340 "," 00:41:08,590"
Nothing to fear.,"00:41:08,716 "," 00:41:09,883"
You've never been a very good liar.,"00:41:09,968 "," 00:41:11,468"
Take her to your chambers.,"00:41:12,428 "," 00:41:13,470"
I'll come for you when it's safe.,"00:41:13,555 "," 00:41:15,430"
You take care.,"00:41:15,557 "," 00:41:17,057"
"Despite all I have survived,","00:41:17,142 "," 00:41:18,142"
my queen still worries over me.,"00:41:19,060 "," 00:41:21,770"
It's only because I worry over you,"00:41:21,980 "," 00:41:23,105"
that you have survived.,"00:41:23,231 "," 00:41:25,065"
Listen to me now.,"00:41:27,569 "," 00:41:28,777"
"I need you to do everything I ask,no questions.","00:41:28,945 "," 00:41:31,905"
"Yes, ma'am.","00:41:32,031 "," 00:41:33,198"
Oh!,"00:42:14,240 "," 00:42:15,407"
 Ow! Ah!,"00:45:45,785 "," 00:45:47,160"
The throne of Asgardis destroyed! To the king!,"00:46:42,758 "," 00:46:45,886"
Frigga.,"00:47:01,694 "," 00:47:02,694"
"Stand down, creature,","00:47:11,496 "," 00:47:13,914"
and you may still survive this.,"00:47:14,081 "," 00:47:15,707"
"I have survived worse, woman.","00:47:15,791 "," 00:47:17,876"
Who are you?,"00:47:19,337 "," 00:47:20,712"
I am Malekith.,"00:47:21,255 "," 00:47:23,298"
And I would have what is mine.,"00:47:23,466 "," 00:47:26,092"
Ah!,"00:47:38,356 "," 00:47:39,356"
"You have taken something, child.","00:47:56,749 "," 00:47:58,917"
Give it back.,"00:47:59,961 "," 00:48:01,002"
Witch!,"00:48:15,393 "," 00:48:16,476"
Where is the Aether?,"00:48:20,189 "," 00:48:21,690"
I'll never tell you.,"00:48:21,816 "," 00:48:24,109"
I believe you.,"00:48:25,111 "," 00:48:26,319"
No!,"00:48:28,823 "," 00:48:30,991"
"The universe rotateson a 5,000year cycle","00:51:57,740 "," 00:51:59,908"
"and once a cycle, all the worlds align.","00:52:00,785 "," 00:52:03,161"
Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.,"00:52:03,829 "," 00:52:06,748"
"Oh, thank you. And this is another world.","00:52:07,500 "," 00:52:09,542"
"Normally, they're separate.","00:52:09,710 "," 00:52:11,669"
"But during the Alignment,","00:52:11,837 "," 00:52:13,546"
"everything is connected,all nine realms.","00:52:13,631 "," 00:52:17,175"
All nine realmsare passing through each other,"00:52:17,343 "," 00:52:19,511"
"and gravity, light, and even matter,","00:52:19,595 "," 00:52:21,930"
is crashing from one world to the other.,"00:52:22,223 "," 00:52:24,641"
"But if this happens to us now,the result will be cataclysmic.","00:52:26,977 "," 00:52:30,897"
My gravimetric spikes can stabilizethe focal point of the Convergence.,"00:52:30,981 "," 00:52:35,485"
"This time, the Alignment","00:52:36,195 "," 00:52:38,488"
and all the other worldswould just pass us by.,"00:52:38,572 "," 00:52:41,574"
It's beautiful.,"00:52:41,742 "," 00:52:43,243"
It's simple. Any questions?,"00:52:44,745 "," 00:52:46,913"
Yeah.,"00:52:50,042 "," 00:52:51,084"
Can I have my shoe back?,"00:52:51,544 "," 00:52:54,254"
Heal. You will need your strengthto reclaim the Aether.,"00:53:02,012 "," 00:53:06,015"
"And when you wake,we will kill them all.","00:53:06,517 "," 00:53:10,103"
Jane Foster?,"00:53:45,681 "," 00:53:46,973"
You need to come with us.,"00:53:48,642 "," 00:53:50,810"
We are still unable to restorethe palace shields.,"00:53:52,062 "," 00:53:55,148"
Our artillery cannot detect them.,"00:53:55,274 "," 00:53:56,691"
Even Heimdall cannot see them.,"00:53:56,817 "," 00:53:58,610"
"My king, we are all but defenseless.","00:54:01,989 "," 00:54:05,909"
She's your prisoner now?,"00:54:08,495 "," 00:54:09,954"
Leave us.,"00:54:12,333 "," 00:54:13,666"
I do not wish to fight with you.,"00:54:22,676 "," 00:54:24,844"
Nor I with you.,"00:54:25,346 "," 00:54:27,096"
But I intend to pursue Malekith.,"00:54:27,181 "," 00:54:29,015"
We possess the Aether.,"00:54:29,183 "," 00:54:30,475"
Malekith will come to us.,"00:54:31,143 "," 00:54:32,352"
"Yes, and he will destroy us.","00:54:32,519 "," 00:54:34,520"
You overestimatethe power of these creatures.,"00:54:34,605 "," 00:54:36,731"
"No, I value our people's lives.","00:54:36,857 "," 00:54:39,192"
"I'll take Jane to the Dark World,and draw the enemy away from Asgard.","00:54:39,360 "," 00:54:42,654"
"When Malekithpulls the Aether from Jane,","00:54:43,405 "," 00:54:45,615"
it will be exposed and vulnerable.,"00:54:45,699 "," 00:54:47,700"
And I will destroy it and him.,"00:54:47,868 "," 00:54:49,661"
"If you fail, you risk this weapon","00:54:51,705 "," 00:54:54,457"
falling into the hands of our enemies.,"00:54:54,541 "," 00:54:56,376"
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.,"00:54:56,502 "," 00:54:58,878"
"His ship could be over our headsright now,","00:54:59,004 "," 00:55:00,964"
we would never even know it.,"00:55:01,173 "," 00:55:02,382"
If and when he comes,"00:55:02,549 "," 00:55:03,716"
"his men will fallon 10,000 Asgardian blades.","00:55:03,801 "," 00:55:07,971"
And how many of our menshall fall on theirs?,"00:55:08,055 "," 00:55:09,472"
As many as are needed!,"00:55:09,598 "," 00:55:11,557"
Ah!,"00:55:14,645 "," 00:55:15,728"
We will fight!,"00:55:20,526 "," 00:55:22,068"
Till the last Asgardian breath.,"00:55:24,571 "," 00:55:27,115"
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.,"00:55:27,908 "," 00:55:30,952"
Then how are you differentfrom Malekith?,"00:55:33,080 "," 00:55:36,207"
"The difference, my son, is that I will win.","00:55:39,420 "," 00:55:42,005"
"Jane isn't calling me back,Erik isn't calling me back,","00:55:56,311 "," 00:55:59,105"
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.isn't calling me back.,"00:55:59,231 "," 00:56:01,149"
 What's S.H.I.E.L.D? It's a secret.,"00:56:01,275 "," 00:56:03,109"
"Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.","00:56:03,193 "," 00:56:05,111"
"Thor came back,he took Jane to Asgard,","00:56:05,237 "," 00:56:08,031"
and I'm not surewhat I'm supposed to do.,"00:56:08,282 "," 00:56:11,743"
Something elsewent missing this week,"00:56:11,827 "," 00:56:13,745"
when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig,"00:56:13,829 "," 00:56:16,956"
notable for his involvementin the alien invasion of New York,"00:56:17,082 "," 00:56:20,626"
streaked nude across...,"00:56:20,794 "," 00:56:22,086"
"Darcy,you really need to look at this.","00:56:22,254 "," 00:56:24,797"
"Your friend, Erik...","00:56:24,965 "," 00:56:26,132"
What was his last name again?,"00:56:26,216 "," 00:56:27,967"
And began shouting at visitorsto the historic site.,"00:56:28,927 "," 00:56:32,305"
He was later taken into police custody,"00:56:32,473 "," 00:56:34,515"
for psychiatric evaluation.,"00:56:35,142 "," 00:56:37,435"
Police are still refusing to confirm...,"00:56:37,603 "," 00:56:39,645"
You were not at Odin's war council.,"00:56:50,157 "," 00:56:52,200"
The Bifrost is closedby your father's orders.,"00:56:52,326 "," 00:56:54,660"
No one is to come,"00:56:54,870 "," 00:56:56,162"
or to go.,"00:56:56,246 "," 00:56:57,538"
We face an enemythat is invisible even to me.,"00:56:59,625 "," 00:57:02,335"
What use is a guardian such as that?,"00:57:02,503 "," 00:57:06,214"
"Malekith will return, you know this.","00:57:07,674 "," 00:57:10,426"
I need your help.,"00:57:12,971 "," 00:57:14,013"
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.Not even for you.,"00:57:14,640 "," 00:57:18,226"
I'm not asking you to.,"00:57:18,352 "," 00:57:19,977"
The realms need their Allfather strongand unchallenged,"00:57:20,187 "," 00:57:22,522"
whether he is or not.,"00:57:22,689 "," 00:57:25,233"
"But he is blinded, Heimdall","00:57:25,400 "," 00:57:27,110"
by hatred and by grief.,"00:57:27,194 "," 00:57:28,945"
As are we all.,"00:57:29,029 "," 00:57:30,696"
I see clearly enough.,"00:57:30,781 "," 00:57:31,989"
The risks are too great.,"00:57:32,074 "," 00:57:33,699"
Everything we do from here on is a risk.,"00:57:33,992 "," 00:57:36,702"
There is no other way.,"00:57:36,870 "," 00:57:38,579"
What do you require of me?,"00:57:42,543 "," 00:57:44,752"
What I'm about to ask of youis treason of the highest order.,"00:57:44,878 "," 00:57:48,422"
Success will bring us exileand failure shall mean our death.,"00:57:48,715 "," 00:57:52,760"
Malekith knew the Aether was here.He can sense its power.,"00:57:55,639 "," 00:57:59,725"
"If we do nothing,he will come for it again","00:58:00,269 "," 00:58:02,436"
"but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.","00:58:02,604 "," 00:58:06,732"
We must move Jane offworld.,"00:58:07,734 "," 00:58:09,735"
The Bifrost has been shut down,"00:58:09,903 "," 00:58:11,571"
and the Tesseractlocked away in the vault.,"00:58:11,697 "," 00:58:13,406"
There are other paths off Asgard.Ways known only to a few.,"00:58:13,574 "," 00:58:17,702"
"One, actually.","00:58:17,786 "," 00:58:19,704"
No.,"00:58:21,790 "," 00:58:23,541"
Thor. After all this time,"00:58:27,921 "," 00:58:31,174"
and now you come to visit me.,"00:58:31,258 "," 00:58:33,926"
Why?,"00:58:35,137 "," 00:58:36,429"
Have you come to gloat? To mock?,"00:58:37,764 "," 00:58:40,808"
"Loki, enough.","00:58:40,934 "," 00:58:42,560"
No more illusions.,"00:58:42,978 "," 00:58:44,812"
"Now you see me, brother.","00:58:51,987 "," 00:58:54,071"
Did she suffer?,"00:59:02,789 "," 00:59:04,498"
I did not come here to share our grief.,"00:59:04,625 "," 00:59:06,959"
Instead I offer you the chanceof a far richer sacrament.,"00:59:07,085 "," 00:59:10,171"
Go on.,"00:59:11,590 "," 00:59:12,798"
I know you seek vengeanceas much as I do.,"00:59:12,966 "," 00:59:15,635"
You help me escape Asgardand I will grant it to you.,"00:59:15,719 "," 00:59:18,679"
Vengeance,"00:59:18,972 "," 00:59:20,348"
"and afterward, this cell.","00:59:20,515 "," 00:59:22,934"
You must be truly desperateto come to me for help.,"00:59:29,691 "," 00:59:34,487"
What makes you thinkyou can trust me?,"00:59:36,156 "," 00:59:37,740"
I don't.,"00:59:37,824 "," 00:59:39,242"
Mother did.,"00:59:40,953 "," 00:59:42,036"
"But you should know that whenwe fought each other in the past,","00:59:43,330 "," 00:59:45,831"
I did so with a glimmer of hope,"00:59:46,667 "," 00:59:48,125"
that my brotherwas still in there somewhere.,"00:59:48,210 "," 00:59:50,086"
That hope no longer existsto protect you.,"00:59:51,713 "," 00:59:54,173"
"You betray me, and I will kill you.","00:59:55,008 "," 00:59:58,386"
Hmm.,"01:00:01,056 "," 01:00:02,390"
When do we start?,"01:00:03,892 "," 01:00:05,601"
He will betray you.,"01:00:05,686 "," 01:00:07,019"
He will try.,"01:00:07,104 "," 01:00:08,729"
"This is so unlike you, brother.","01:00:13,318 "," 01:00:15,695"
So clandestine.,"01:00:15,862 "," 01:00:17,863"
Are you sure you wouldn'trather just punch your way out?,"01:00:17,990 "," 01:00:20,199"
"If you keep speaking, I just might.","01:00:20,993 "," 01:00:22,868"
Fine. As you wish.,"01:00:22,995 "," 01:00:24,829"
I'm not even here.,"01:00:25,205 "," 01:00:26,372"
Is this better?,"01:00:27,708 "," 01:00:29,208"
It's better company at least.,"01:00:29,376 "," 01:00:31,877"
"Still, we could be less conspicuous.","01:00:32,004 "," 01:00:35,923"
"Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.","01:00:37,509 "," 01:00:39,844"
It will hurt no lesswhen I kill you in this form.,"01:00:41,847 "," 01:00:44,390"
Very well. Perhaps youprefer one of your new companions,"01:00:44,558 "," 01:00:47,727"
given that you seemto like them so much.,"01:00:47,894 "," 01:00:49,937"
"Oh, this is much better.","01:00:50,522 "," 01:00:52,523"
Ooh.,"01:00:52,607 "," 01:00:53,607"
The costume is a bit much. So tight.,"01:00:53,942 "," 01:00:56,569"
But the confidence...,"01:00:56,737 "," 01:00:58,029"
I can feel the righteousness surging.,"01:00:58,196 "," 01:01:00,614"
"Hey, do you want to havea rousing discussion about truth?","01:01:00,782 "," 01:01:03,242"
Honor? Patriotism?,"01:01:03,702 "," 01:01:04,910"
God bless Amer...,"01:01:04,995 "," 01:01:05,995"
What?,"01:01:08,707 "," 01:01:10,041"
You could at leastfurnish me with a weapon.,"01:01:14,546 "," 01:01:16,922"
"My dagger, something.","01:01:17,090 "," 01:01:18,966"
At last.,"01:01:24,473 "," 01:01:25,723"
A little common sense.,"01:01:25,807 "," 01:01:27,516"
And I thought you liked tricks.,"01:01:33,648 "," 01:01:36,192"
"Well, what then? Your lovely mortal isbeing guarded by a legion of Einherjar","01:01:36,276 "," 01:01:40,821"
who will see you comingfrom miles away.,"01:01:40,989 "," 01:01:42,740"
I won't be the one who comes for her.,"01:01:42,824 "," 01:01:44,533"
I'm not hungry.,"01:01:52,334 "," 01:01:53,334"
What the...,"01:01:54,127 "," 01:01:55,878"
Good. Let's go.,"01:01:55,962 "," 01:01:58,214"
You're...,"01:02:03,595 "," 01:02:04,637"
"I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.","01:02:04,805 "," 01:02:06,764"
That was for New York.,"01:02:06,848 "," 01:02:09,392"
I like her.,"01:02:09,476 "," 01:02:10,851"
And what of the Allfather?,"01:02:10,977 "," 01:02:12,645"
It is my sworn duty to notify himof crimes against the throne.,"01:02:13,313 "," 01:02:17,024"
You called me here on an urgent matter.,"01:02:17,150 "," 01:02:20,778"
What is it?,"01:02:21,822 "," 01:02:22,822"
"Treason, my lord.","01:02:23,281 "," 01:02:24,573"
Whose?,"01:02:24,658 "," 01:02:25,991"
Mine.,"01:02:26,701 "," 01:02:27,743"
My king!,"01:02:28,495 "," 01:02:29,995"
The mortal has been taken.,"01:02:30,080 "," 01:02:32,081"
Stop Thor.,"01:02:35,961 "," 01:02:36,961"
By any means necessary.,"01:02:37,045 "," 01:02:39,171"
There they are! Take them.,"01:02:41,883 "," 01:02:44,385"
On my command.,"01:02:44,511 "," 01:02:45,469"
I'll hold them off. Take her.,"01:02:45,554 "," 01:02:47,763"
Thank you.,"01:02:48,390 "," 01:02:49,807"
"Betray him, and I'll kill you.","01:02:52,519 "," 01:02:54,770"
"It's good to see you, too, Sif.","01:02:57,023 "," 01:02:59,608"
Assuming you can get Loki's helpand you can free this mortal,"01:03:05,198 "," 01:03:09,535"
what good would it do?,"01:03:09,661 "," 01:03:11,162"
We'd all be dead the minutewe step one foot outside the palace.,"01:03:11,246 "," 01:03:14,123"
"That, my friend,is why we won't be leaving by foot.","01:03:14,207 "," 01:03:17,418"
I will give you as much time as I can.,"01:03:21,548 "," 01:03:23,299"
"Thank you, my friend.","01:03:23,383 "," 01:03:25,217"
If you even think about betraying him...,"01:03:29,389 "," 01:03:32,558"
You'll kill me?,"01:03:32,684 "," 01:03:34,310"
"Evidently, there will be a line.","01:03:34,394 "," 01:03:36,395"
I thought you saidyou knew how to fly this thing.,"01:03:51,703 "," 01:03:53,787"
"I said, How hard could it be?","01:03:53,955 "," 01:03:55,748"
They're on the ship!,"01:03:59,127 "," 01:04:00,127"
Get to the ship!,"01:04:00,962 "," 01:04:02,254"
"Well, whatever you're doing, brother,I suggest you do it faster.","01:04:05,967 "," 01:04:08,552"
"Shut up, Loki.","01:04:08,637 "," 01:04:11,013"
You must have missed something.,"01:04:12,182 "," 01:04:13,265"
"No, I didn't.I'm pressing every button on this thing.","01:04:13,391 "," 01:04:16,101"
"No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.","01:04:16,186 "," 01:04:17,770"
"I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!","01:04:17,896 "," 01:04:19,730"
"Ha, ha!","01:04:22,859 "," 01:04:23,859"
Get him! Get him!,"01:04:27,489 "," 01:04:29,073"
 I think you missed a column. Shut up!,"01:04:57,644 "," 01:05:00,145"
"Look,why don't you let me take over?","01:05:07,404 "," 01:05:08,654"
I'm clearly the better pilot.,"01:05:08,738 "," 01:05:09,989"
"Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,","01:05:10,282 "," 01:05:12,199"
which one can actually fly?,"01:05:12,325 "," 01:05:13,826"
"Oh, dear. Is she dead?","01:05:24,337 "," 01:05:25,921"

I'm okay.,"01:05:27,799 "," 01:05:28,799"
Ah!,"01:05:30,760 "," 01:05:31,927"

Now they're following us.,"01:05:39,394 "," 01:05:40,769"
Now they're firing at us.,"01:05:46,151 "," 01:05:47,276"
"Yeah, thank youfor the commentary, Loki,","01:05:47,444 "," 01:05:48,777"
it's not at all distracting!,"01:05:48,862 "," 01:05:50,195"
Well done.You just decapitated your grandfather.,"01:05:54,743 "," 01:05:57,369"
"You know, this is wonderful.","01:06:08,798 "," 01:06:10,132"
This is a tremendous idea.,"01:06:10,258 "," 01:06:12,551"
"Let's steal the biggest,most obvious ship in the universe","01:06:12,719 "," 01:06:15,804"
and escape in that.,"01:06:15,972 "," 01:06:17,222"
"Flying around the city,","01:06:17,307 "," 01:06:18,474"

"It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!","01:06:21,061 "," 01:06:22,770"

You lied to me.,"01:06:45,794 "," 01:06:47,753"
I'm impressed.,"01:06:49,005 "," 01:06:50,381"
I'm glad you're pleased.,"01:06:50,465 "," 01:06:51,924"
"Now, do as you promised.","01:06:52,008 "," 01:06:53,008"
And take us to your secret pathway.,"01:06:53,093 "," 01:06:54,927"
 Fandral. Right.,"01:07:18,159 "," 01:07:19,702"
For Asgard.,"01:07:23,415 "," 01:07:24,415"
"Nothing personal, boys.","01:07:30,046 "," 01:07:31,130"

"If it were easy, everyone would do it.","01:07:47,897 "," 01:07:51,233"
 Are you mad? Possibly.,"01:07:51,317 "," 01:07:53,318"
Tada!,"01:08:08,918 "," 01:08:10,502"
We must strike now.,"01:08:16,050 "," 01:08:19,386"
No.,"01:08:20,430 "," 01:08:21,430"

What I could do with the powerthat flows through those veins.,"01:08:50,585 "," 01:08:54,087"
It would consume you.,"01:08:54,172 "," 01:08:56,840"
She's holding up all right.,"01:08:57,801 "," 01:08:59,384"

You'll never be ready.,"01:09:13,900 "," 01:09:15,901"
The only womanwhose love you've prized,"01:09:16,319 "," 01:09:17,820"
will be snatched from you.,"01:09:17,904 "," 01:09:19,696"
And will that satisfy you?,"01:09:19,781 "," 01:09:21,073"
Satisfaction is not in my nature.,"01:09:21,199 "," 01:09:22,741"
Surrender is not in mine.,"01:09:22,826 "," 01:09:25,035"
 The son of Odin... No.,"01:09:25,829 "," 01:09:27,329"

"You had her tricks, but I had her trust.","01:09:32,085 "," 01:09:34,086"
Trust?,"01:09:34,212 "," 01:09:35,504"
Was that her last expression?,"01:09:36,422 "," 01:09:37,923"
Trust? When you let her die?,"01:09:38,550 "," 01:09:40,759"
 What help were you in your cell? Who put me there?,"01:09:40,885 "," 01:09:43,595"
Who put me there?,"01:09:43,680 "," 01:09:45,097"
You know damn well!,"01:09:45,223 "," 01:09:46,223"

Are you all right?,"01:11:40,338 "," 01:11:41,797"
I've had a god in my brain.,"01:11:41,965 "," 01:11:43,799"
I don't recommend it.,"01:11:45,134 "," 01:11:46,593"

Where did they go?,"01:12:12,161 "," 01:12:14,329"
What the hell was that?,"01:12:27,135 "," 01:12:29,428"
Why are you smiling?,"01:12:29,929 "," 01:12:31,596"

He is an enemy of Asgard.,"01:15:00,496 "," 01:15:02,747"
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.,"01:15:02,832 "," 01:15:05,584"
Look at me.,"01:15:19,807 "," 01:15:20,932"

It's all right.,"01:20:29,283 "," 01:20:30,783"
I'll tell Father what you did here today.,"01:20:30,910 "," 01:20:34,412"
I didn't do it for him.,"01:20:37,500 "," 01:20:40,418"
No!,"01:20:48,969 "," 01:20:51,346"
He's going to unleash it.,"01:21:45,150 "," 01:21:47,193"
"Not just on Asgard, or on a star.Malekith is going to destroy everything.","01:21:47,319 "," 01:21:52,490"
How?,"01:21:52,616 "," 01:21:53,741"
"Jane, how?","01:21:54,827 "," 01:21:55,994"
I saw him on Earth.Why would he go to Earth?,"01:21:56,120 "," 01:21:59,330"
The Convergence.,"01:21:59,915 "," 01:22:01,291"
"Oh, God.","01:22:01,458 "," 01:22:02,625"
None of this would have happenedif I hadn't found the Aether.,"01:22:02,710 "," 01:22:04,711"
Then Malekithwould've only possessed it,"01:22:05,921 "," 01:22:07,672"
that much sooner.,"01:22:07,798 "," 01:22:09,465"
I only found itbecause I was looking for you.,"01:22:09,550 "," 01:22:12,010"
Jane...,"01:22:12,636 "," 01:22:13,886"
Now we're trapped here.,"01:22:15,514 "," 01:22:17,223"
It's not me.,"01:22:23,772 "," 01:22:24,981"

"Hi, Jane, it's Richard.","01:22:27,610 "," 01:22:28,818"
Richard? Where are you?,"01:22:28,986 "," 01:22:30,737"
I'm still at the office.,"01:22:30,863 "," 01:22:32,071"
It's been a crazy day here today.,"01:22:32,197 "," 01:22:34,157"
" Oh, my God, this is amazing. Is it?","01:22:34,241 "," 01:22:36,159"
I quite enjoyed our lunch,"01:22:36,285 "," 01:22:37,493"
despite never actuallyordering anything.,"01:22:37,578 "," 01:22:39,662"
How am I getting service here?,"01:22:39,747 "," 01:22:41,164"
Is this a bad time?Do you want me to try you later?,"01:22:41,248 "," 01:22:43,374"
"No, no, no. Please, whateveryou do, do not hang up the phone.","01:22:43,500 "," 01:22:46,669"
"Okay, then.","01:22:47,546 "," 01:22:48,671"
I was just wonderingif you want to try again.,"01:22:48,756 "," 01:22:51,132"

Come on.,"01:23:05,773 "," 01:23:06,773"
I'm losing you there.Are you in a tunnel?,"01:23:06,857 "," 01:23:07,940"
Where are we going?,"01:23:08,108 "," 01:23:09,525"
Hello?,"01:23:09,610 "," 01:23:10,610"
Why are there so many shoes in here?,"01:23:10,736 "," 01:23:12,570"
I'll just text her.,"01:23:14,156 "," 01:23:15,990"
"So, who's Richard?","01:23:28,295 "," 01:23:29,462"

 Jane! Hey.,"01:23:39,431 "," 01:23:40,890"
You can't just leave like that.,"01:23:40,974 "," 01:23:42,725"
The whole world is going crazy.,"01:23:42,810 "," 01:23:44,102"
All the stuff we saw is spreading.,"01:23:44,269 "," 01:23:46,104"
 Did you go to a party? Erik?,"01:23:47,606 "," 01:23:49,440"

"Oh, he, uh...He says it helps him think.","01:23:57,408 "," 01:23:59,158"
"Okay, well, I'm going to needeverything you got on this.","01:23:59,284 "," 01:24:00,868"
"All the work you've been doingon gravimetric anomalies, everything.","01:24:00,953 "," 01:24:03,663"
Okay.,"01:24:03,789 "," 01:24:04,956"
"Are you well, Erik?","01:24:05,040 "," 01:24:07,125"
"Your brother's not coming, is he?","01:24:07,584 "," 01:24:09,085"
Loki is dead.,"01:24:10,087 "," 01:24:11,421"
"Oh, thank God!","01:24:11,505 "," 01:24:12,588"

Thank you.,"01:24:16,093 "," 01:24:17,635"
"Forgive me, my liege.","01:24:41,243 "," 01:24:43,119"
I've returned fromthe Dark World with news.,"01:24:43,954 "," 01:24:46,456"
Thor?,"01:24:48,917 "," 01:24:50,001"
"There was no sign of Thor,or the weapon, but...","01:24:50,669 "," 01:24:55,089"
What?,"01:24:56,925 "," 01:24:58,134"
We found a body.,"01:25:01,096 "," 01:25:02,722"
Loki.,"01:25:07,436 "," 01:25:08,561"
Malekith is going tofire the Aether at a spot,"01:25:12,649 "," 01:25:14,484"
where all the nine worldsare connecting.,"01:25:14,651 "," 01:25:16,569"
Amplifying the weapon's impact.,"01:25:16,695 "," 01:25:19,155"
"For each additional world,","01:25:19,239 "," 01:25:20,656"
the power will increase exponentially.,"01:25:20,783 "," 01:25:22,867"
The effect would be universal.,"01:25:23,160 "," 01:25:26,037"
But the Alignment is only temporary.,"01:25:26,163 "," 01:25:27,789"
He must be inexactly the right place at the right time.,"01:25:27,873 "," 01:25:30,917"
"Well, how do we know where that is?","01:25:31,043 "," 01:25:32,710"
We follow the directions.,"01:25:33,921 "," 01:25:36,339"
This has happened before,"01:25:36,507 "," 01:25:37,757"
"thousands of years ago,and the Ancients were there to see it.","01:25:37,883 "," 01:25:41,219"

They made use of the gravitationaleffects of the Convergence.,"01:25:46,892 "," 01:25:50,311"
And they left us a map.,"01:25:50,395 "," 01:25:52,480"

The walls between worldswill be almost nonexistent.,"01:26:06,119 "," 01:26:08,746"

The very fabric of realityis going to be torn apart.,"01:26:13,794 "," 01:26:16,420"
I better get my pants.,"01:26:19,675 "," 01:26:21,926"
Focus! This is important.,"01:26:23,512 "," 01:26:24,846"
We have to hammer them inall around the site,"01:26:25,013 "," 01:26:26,472"
and then Jane and Erikwill activate them from the tower.,"01:26:26,598 "," 01:26:28,891"
They're taped together.,"01:26:29,226 "," 01:26:30,685"

Not by your hand.,"01:28:25,550 "," 01:28:27,051"

We're running out of time.,"01:28:37,479 "," 01:28:38,896"
 Almost there. Are you sure this is going to work?,"01:28:39,022 "," 01:28:41,357"
"These devices were madeto detect anomalies, not cause them.","01:28:41,441 "," 01:28:44,026"

Done.,"01:29:32,951 "," 01:29:34,035"
The Convergencewill be in full effect in 7 minutes.,"01:29:40,959 "," 01:29:43,669"
That just means we have tokeep Malekith busy for 8.,"01:29:43,795 "," 01:29:45,963"
