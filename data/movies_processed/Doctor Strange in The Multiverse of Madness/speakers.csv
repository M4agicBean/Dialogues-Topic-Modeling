Speaker,Line
America,Did it kill it.
Defender Strange,No. Well kill it with this.
America,The Book of Vishanti.
Defender Strange,We cant let it get your power. Get to the book.
America,How do we get across.
Defender Strange,Jump.
Defender Strange,Its too strong. I cant hold it.
Defender Strange,Im so sorry. This is the only way.
America,What are you doing.
Defender Strange,We cant let that thing take your power. You cant control it. But I can.
America,But were friends.
Defender Strange,"I know. But in the grand calculus of the Multiverse, your sacrifice is worth more than your life."
Doctor Nicodemus West,Doctor Strange.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Doctor West.
Doctor Nicodemus West,Havent seen you in a while.
Doctor Stephen Strange,I was a little preoccupied being dust in the air for five years.
Doctor Nicodemus West,So were a lot of us. While I was gone. thank you for asking. I lost both my cats. And my brother.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Im very sorry.
Doctor Nicodemus West,"Thank you. I, uh. I guess what keeps me up at night is wondering. Did it have to happen that way. Was there any other path."
Doctor Stephen Strange,No. But I made the only play we had.
Doctor Nicodomus West,"Of course, you do. The best surgeon and the best superhero. But you still didnt get the girl."
Doctor Christine Palmer,"Glass of red, please."
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Allow me, Miss."
Doctor Stephen Strange,A little too on the nose.
Doctor Christine Palmer,"What, for you, at my wedding. Nah. It was perfect."
Doctor Stephen Strange,Congratulations.
Doctor Christine Palmer,"Thank you. Theres Charlie. I have to introduce you because hes kind of. Its embarrassing, but hes a big fan."
Doctor Stephen Strange,"So. Hey, uh, Christine. umm. I should have. I wish it had been different. I never stopped caring about us, but I had to make sacrifices. To protect you. Im sorry."
Doctor Christine Palmer,It was never gonna work out between us.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Why not.
Doctor Christine Palmer,"Because Stephen. You have to be the one holding the knife. And I always respected you for it, but I couldnt love you for it."
Doctor Stephen Strange,How long have you had that one in the barrel.
Doctor Christine Palmer,Long time.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Yeah. I bet. Truly, Im just glad that youre happy."
Doctor Christine Palmer,"I am. I really, really am."
Doctor Stephen Strange,Good.
Doctor Christine Palmer,Are you.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Im happy.
Doctor Christine Palmer,Good. You deserve it.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Thank you.
America,Look out.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Do I know you.
Wong,Help. Youre welcome. Do you know its ancient custom to bow in the presence of the Sorcerer Supreme.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Yeah. Im aware of the customs. Hold it. Hold it.
Charlie,Woah. Thats incredible.
Doctor Christine Palmer,Yeah.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Oh, god."
Wong,Whos this.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question. Hey, kid. What did that creature want with you."
Wong,Where are your parents.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Take her back to the Sanct. She took my slingy.
Wong,She took your slingy.
America,That wasnt a dream. It was another universe.
America,How much experience do you guys have with the Multiverse.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"We have experience with the Multiverse. Most recently, there was an incident with Spider-Man."
America,With what Man.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider.
Wong,Hence the name.
America,Gross. Does he look like a spider.
Doctor Stephen Strange,No. More like a man.
Wong,"Climbs walls, shoot webs."
Doctor Stephen Strange,Yeah. Bingo.
America,Out his butt.
Doctor Stephen Strange,No. Maybe. I dont know.
Wong,Ew.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Honestly, I hope not."
America,Super weird.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Youre gonna get a stomachache.
America,Im from another universe. How do you know my stomach works the same as yours.
Doctor Stephen Strange,I dont. I dont even know if youre from another universe. Which is why Im still sitting here waiting for you to enlighten us.
America,"Frankly, of the two Doctor Stranges that Ive met, you are not my favorite."
Doctor Stephen Strange,Which means.
America,He cant speak Spanish.
Wong,I dont even know if he speaks his own language.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Look, I left a very nice wedding to save a smartness kid from getting eaten by an octopus. Tell me--"
Wong,Whose wedding.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Christines.
Wong,You went.
America Chavez,Holy shit. You married Christine.
Passer-by,Do you mind.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Yes, I do. No, I didnt. Yes. You need to explain to me whats going on. Why was that octopus trying to eat you."
America Chavez,That thing was trying to kidnap me. Its like a henchman who works for a demon. All we knew is that they wanted to take my power for themselves.
Doctor Stephen Strange,What power.
America Chavez,I can travel the Multiverse.
Doctor Stephen Strange,What.
Wong,You can physically move from one universe to another.
Doctor Stephen Strange,How.
America Chavez,"Thats the problem. I dont know how. I cant control it. Only happens when Im really, really afraid."
Doctor Stephen Strange,Okay. Did the other me know how to defeat this demon.
America Chavez,"Well, you just knew this magical book of pure good, that gives a sorcerer whatever they need to defeat their enemy."
Doctor Stephen Strange,The Book of Vishanti. Its not real. Its a fairy tale that doesnt exist.
Wong,"Actually, it does. I found out in the secret book you get when you become Sorcerer Supreme."
Doctor Stephen Strange,Unbelievable.
America Chavez,Youre not the Sorcerer Supreme.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"No, I am not the Sorcerer Supreme."
America,Other you was Sorcerer Supreme in his universe.
Wong,"Although it does exist, the Book of Vishanti is said to be unreachable."
America,"It is, except. we reached it. Then the demon caught up with us. I thought youd protect me, but. You didnt."
Doctor Stephen Strange,That was the fight in my dream.
America,That wasnt a dream.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Prove it. It wasnt a dream. That means. Dreams are windows into the lives of our Multiversal selves.
America,That was his theory.
Wong,So that recurring nightmare where Im running naked from a clown.
America Chavez,"Somewhere out there, its real."
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Somewhere out there, I had a ponytail."
Wong,There could be more creatures coming for her.
Doctor Stephen Strange,That power is dangerous enough in the hands of a kid. Imagine if a real threat acquired it.
Wong,"It occurs to me, young one, we dont know your name."
America Chavez,America Chavez.
Wong,"Miss Chavez, will you come with us to Kamar-Taj. Youll be safe there."
America Chavez,How do I know you wont betray me like he did.
Doctor Stephen Strange,I guess youre just gonna have to trust me.
Wong,What do we do with him. Thats gotta violate an ordinance.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Ive buried worse.
Wong,"The creature that killed him, did. did it have the same markings as the octopus."
Doctor Stephen Strange,Runes.
Wong,This isnt sorcery.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Its witchcraft.
Wong,Do we know anyone whos faced such a thing.
Doctor Stephen Strange,I think I might.
Billy and Tommy,Chocolate.
Wanda 2,Hey. What did I say.
Billy and Tommy,But we cant wait.
Wanda 2,Well what did I say. Go wash your hands.
Tommy,"Mom, come on. Im too old for that."
Wanda 2,Okay.
Billy,"You can tuck me in, Mom."
Wanda 2,I will. You know. A family is forever. We could never truly leave each other even if we tried.
Tommy,"Mom, I changed my mind. You can come tuck me in if you want."
Wanda 2,Okay. Love you.
Strange,"Apples, right."
Wanda,Eventually.
Strange,Smells.
Wanda,Sweet.
Strange,So I can see.
Wanda,"Well, I knew sooner or later youd. show up, wanting to discuss what happened at WestView. I made mistakes, and people were hurt."
Strange,But you put things right in the end and that was never in doubt. Im not here to talk about WestView.
Wanda,Then what are you here for.
Strange,We need your help.
Wanda,With what.
Strange,What do you know about the Multiverse.
Wanda,"The Multiverse. Vis had his theories. He believed it was real. And, dangerous."
Strange,"Well, he was right about both. We found a girl who can somehow travel across it but shes being pursued."
Wanda,Pursued by who.
Strange,"Some kind of demon. One that covets her power for itself. Now weve taken her to Kamar-Taj, and. Weve got our defenses, but. We could use an Avenger."
Wanda,There are other Avengers.
Strange,"Yeah, but given a choice between the Archer with a mohawk, and several bug-themed crimefighters, or. One of the most powerful magic wielders on the planet, its an easy call. Come to Kamar-Taj. Itll get you back on a lunch box."
Wanda,What if you brought America here.
Strange,Here.
Wanda,"Yeah. I know what its like. To be on your own, hunted for abilities you never wanted. I can protect her."
Wanda,"You never told me her name, did you."
Strange,"No. No, I didnt."
Wanda,"You know, the Hex was the easy part. The lying, not so much."
Strange,The Darkhold.
Wanda,Youve heard of the Darkhold.
Strange,I know its the Book of the Damned. And that it corrupts everything and everyone that it touches. I wonder what its done to you.
Wanda,The Darkhold only showed me the truth. Everything I lost. can be mine again.
Strange,What do you want with America. What do you want with the Multiverse.
Wanda,"Im going to leave this reality, and go to one where I can be with my children."
Strange,"Wanda, your children arent real. You created them using magic."
Wanda,"Thats what every mother does. If you knew. there was a universe, where you were happy, wouldnt you wanna go there."
Strange,I am happy.
Wanda,I know better than most what self-deception looks like.
Strange,"What youre doing is a flagrant violation of every natural law. If you take that childs power, she wont survive."
Wanda,"I dont relish hurting anyone, Stephen. But shes not a child. Shes a supernatural being. Such raw power could wreak havoc on this, and other worlds. Her sacrifice would be for the greater good."
Strange,Well you can kiss the lunchbox goodbye because thats the kind of justification our enemies use.
Wanda,Is it the one you use. When you gave Thanos the Time Stone.
Strange,"That was war, and I did what I had to do."
Wanda,You break the rules and become a hero. I do it and I become the enemy. That doesnt seem fair.
Strange,What happens now.
Wanda,"Return to Kamar-Taj, and prepare to hand over America Chavez by sundown. Peacefully. After that. Youll never see me again."
Strange,And if we dont.
Wanda,Then it wont be Wanda who comes for her. It will be the Scarlet Witch.
Wong,Scarlet Witch.
Wong,"Scarlet Witch is a being of unfathomable magic. She can rewrite reality as she chooses, and is prophesized to either rule, or annihilate the cosmos."
Strange,She took over a whole town using her mind. If she gets Americas power. she could enslave the entire Multiverse.
America,"So the person you went to ask for help, and told exactly where I am, is the person thats trying to kill me."
Strange,Yeah.
Wong,Suspend teaching at once. And arm the students. Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.
Rintrah,Thats the Masters of the Hong Kong and London Sanctum.
Master of Hong Kong Sanctum,Honored to face death again by your side.
Wong,The honor is ours.
Master of London Sanctum,"Whatever the Sorcerer Supreme asks of us, it shall be done."
Wong,Its ancient custom. Choose your words wisely. The fate of the Multiverse may depend on it.
Strange,"Got it. No pressure, then."
Wanda,All this for a child you met yesterday.
Strange,"Wanda, you are justifiably angry. You had to make terrible sacrifices."
Wanda,"I blew a hole through the head of the man I loved. and it meant nothing. Do not speak to me of sacrifice, Stephen Strange. If you give me what I want. Ill send you to a world where you can be with Christine."
Strange,The full might of Kamar-Taj stands against you.
Wong,Defensive positions. Now.
Strange,Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.
Wanda,You have. no idea just how reasonable I have been.
Strange,"Yeah. Book of the Damned, calling yourself a Witch, conjuring creatures to abduct a kid. I dont exactly call that being reasonable."
Wanda,"Sending those creatures after her instead of myself was mercy. And in spite of your hypocrisies. and insults, I have begged you to safely get out of my way. You have exhausted my patience. But I do hope you understand. that even now. whats about to happen. This is me, being. reasonable."
Wong,Hold. Hold.
Strange,Nailed it.
Wong,Reinforce the shield.
Strange,Shes trying to get in their heads.
Wong,Sorcerers. Fortify your mind.
Wanda,Run.
Wong,The shield is down.
Sara,Fire.
Wong,Yes.
Sara,Take cover.
Wong,Fire at will.
Strange,Fall back. Wong.
Wong,Get out of here.
Strange,"You want the girl, youre gonna have to go through me."
Wanda,Fine.
Strange,We gotta get you out of here. Now.
America,Why. What happened.
Wong,Kamar-Taj has fallen.
Strange,Reflections. Shes using the reflections.
Wong,Cover them.
Wanda,You gave all those lives just to keep me from my children.
Strange,You took those lives. You cannot be allowed to cross into the Multiverse.
Wanda,"Im not a monster, Stephen. Im a mother."
Strange,"Wanda, you have no children. They dont exist."
Wanda,"But they do. In every other universe. I know they do. Because I dream of them. Every. night. Of my boys. Of our life together. Every night, the same dream. And every morning. the same. nightmare."
Strange,What if you reach them. What happens to the other you. What happens to their mother.
Doctor Stephen Strange,You okay.
America Chavez,You saved me.
Doctor Stephen Strange,I hope so.
America Chavez,Surprised you didnt puke.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Thats not my first weird trip, kid. So. This is New York in the Multiver."
America Chavez,There it is.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Crap. Cut it out.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Yeah. You got pretty dinged up. Well get you fixed. All right, America. Youve gotta open a portal to get us back there right now."
America Chavez,I dont know how.
Doctor Stephen Strange,You just did it.
America Chavez,Not on purpose.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Wong is back there alone with Wanda and Im the only hope he has.
America Chavez,I cant control my powers.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"You must be able to control it somehow. Even I could. Sorry. Well, what about this universes version of you. Maybe she can control her powers."
America Chavez,This universe doesnt have a me.
Doctor Stephen Strange,What.
America Chavez,None of them do.
Doctor Stephen Strange,But how do you know that.
America Chavez,Because Ive looked. And. because I never dream.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Its okay, kid. Even if you could get me back there, I have no way of fighting Wanda."
America Chavez,What about the Book of Vishanti.
Doctor Stephen Strange,What about it.
America Chavez,Other you thought it could stop whoever was after me.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"Yeah, well, good for other me. Hes not here, is he. I dont know where it is. So unless theres another other me."
America Chavez,We need to go find.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Other other me.
Strange,They go on red.
America,Rule number one of Multiversal travel. You dont know anything.
Strange,"Right. Its red. So, whats rule number two. America. America."
America,"Rule number two. Find food. Preferrably, pizza. Pizza balls."
Strange,Howd you pay for that.
America,"It was free. Foods free in most universes, actually. Its weird you guys have to pay for it."
Pizza Poppa,Hey. You didnt pay for that.
America,Crap. Maybe its not free here.
Pizza Poppa,Pizza Poppa always gets paid.
Strange,"Alright, Pizza Poppa. Relax, shes just a kid."
Pizza Poppa,"Relax yourself there, Doctor Strange. Where did you get this cape from anyway. Oh, that feels authentic."
Strange,"Its not a cape, its a cloak. And I suggest you let go."
Pizza Poppa,"You took this whole suit from the Strange Museum, didnt ya."
Strange,Strange Museum.
Pizza Poppa,"Youre a taker. Why dont you take some mustard, huh."
Strange,Come on. Its not permanent.
America,Is it gonna stop in a few minutes.
Strange,"About three weeks. Those universes we went through, were we paint in one of them."
America,Yeah. You dont wanna get stuck in there. Its really hard to eat.
Strange,How many universes have you been through.
America,"Seventy-two. Seventy-three, counting this one."
Strange,Thats. Thats a lot.
Automatic Voice,"Memory Lane. Replay your significant memories, now in a discounted price. We remember, so you dont forget."
Christine,This is pretty fancy. Sure you didnt have to take out another student loan.
Strange,Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys that we operated on last week.
Christine,"So, I got you a little something. Congratulations."
Strange,What is it.
Christine,Open it and see.
Strange,"Christine, this is. This is amazing. Thank you. We dont have time for this."
Automatic Voice,"Memory Lane. Replay your significant memories, now in a discounted price. We remember, so you dont forget."
Strange,Wheres this.
America,"Home. My moms. Yeah, youre right. This is just a waste of time."
Strange,"Hey, kid. That was the first time that you opened a portal, right."
America,It doesnt matter.
Strange,It does matter. You lost your parents.
America,I didnt lose them. I killed them.
Strange,"No. No, you did not. Dont even think that."
America,"Okay, I opened a portal with the powers I cant control, and sent them to a random, probably deadly universe with no way to escape."
Strange,"Listen, if your moms are anything like their daughter. They survived. Im sure youll meet them again someday."
America,Not bad.
Strange,Thanks.
America,"That woman, in your Memory Lane thing, that was Christine, right."
Strange,"Yes, that was Christine. How do you know her."
America,From other you.
Strange,Were we together.
America,"No, you didnt talk anymore. You blew it."
Strange,Of course.
America,Did you blow it with your Christine.
Strange,"Yes, I guess I did."
America,Why.
Strange,Complicated.
America,More complicated than being chased by a witch through the Multiverse.
Strange,"Yes, actually. It is."
America,Gave his life defeating Thanos.
Strange,"Yeah, see. Were not all bad."
America,If other yous dead. Whos master of the Sanctum.
Strange,"Oh, shit."
America,You know him.
Strange,Yeah. Mordo. Hes actually the first guy who let me into Kamar-Taj.
America,"Oh, great."
Strange,And then he snapped and dedicated his life trying to k*ll me.
America,Oh. Great.
Mordo,I always suspected this day would come.
Strange,You did.
Mordo,Yes. Because you always suspected this day would come. My brother.
Strange,All right.
Mordo,"Come, and tell me everything. About your universe."
Strange,We go on red.
Mordo,"Youre quite formidable too, it seems. A multiversal traveler. But thank the stars you brought Doctor Strange to safety."
Strange,"Well, just cause we jumped ship, doesnt mean were safe. Our Wanda has the ability to conjure demons and monsters to attack America - in other universes."
Mordo,So she has the Darkhold.
Strange,"Oh, you know of the Darkhold."
Mordo,"Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold in this universe, too. I got it here in this Sanctum. We would never risk a weapon that dangerous falling into the wrong hands."
Strange,Damn right.
Mordo,"If your Darkhold is anything like ours, Im afraid she can do far worse than just summon monsters, to come after you."
America,What do you mean.
Mordo,"There is a spell contained within those pages. Corrosive to the soul. A desecration of reality itself. Dreamwalking. A dreamwalking sorcerer projects their own consciousness from their universe into another. Possessing the body of an alternate self. Playing puppeteer, this unholy doppelganger, and pursue their enemies from afar. The possession is not a permanent link between realities, but in the fleeting time they dreamwalk, they can do irreparable damage to the universe they invade. So it may not be a demon that you face. It may be, the Scarlet Witch."
America,"But, why didnt she do that to begin with."
Strange,Because that was her being reasonable. What do you know of the Book of Vishanti.
Mordo,The Darkholds antithesis. It can give a sorcerer whatever power they need to vanquish their enemy.
Strange,I need to.
Mordo,"Im sorry, Stephen. But I hope you, of all people, understand. That it is not Wanda Maximoff who threatens our reality. Its the two of you."
Strange,What was in that tea. You son of a b. Sands of Nisanti.
Mordo,"I only acted, as you would."
Strange,She is coming. You got me.
Wanda 2,"Boys, its time for bed."
Billy and Tommy,"Can we have one more ice cream. - Please, please. - Please. - You know whos best."
Wanda 2,Who.
Billy and Tommy,2003 Tigers.
Billy,Mom.
Wanda,"Yes, sweetheart."
Billy,Where are you going.
Wanda,Just. to take out the trash.
Billy,"Can we show you something. Mom, hurry. Come on. Come on, its important."
Tommy,Mom. Youll like it. Come on. Hurry up. Its important.
Billy,"Okay, so. Listen to this."
Tommy,Im gonna start it.
Billy,"No, I wanna start it."
Tommy,I wanna start it.
Billy,"No, I wanna start."
Wanda,"Why dont you both. start it. whatever. it is, together."
Tommy,Okay.
Billy,Okay. You ready.
Tommy,Yeah.
Billy and Tommy,"Three, two, one, go. We like ice cream like every child should. And if we get some ice cream, we promise to be good."
Sara,Youre alive. Yes. But so many others were lost.
Wong,Set me free. I need to destroy the book.
Sara,No. It cannot be you.
Wong,No.
Billy,Mom. What happened. Are you okay.
Wanda,Billy. Tommy. No. No. I need the Darkhold spells. You are the Sorcerer Supreme. Tell me what you know.
Wong,"Youll have to kill me, witch."
Wanda,Not you. Them.
Wong,"Wanda, stop. Wanda, please. The Darkhold was a copy."
Wanda,A copy.
Wong,Legend speaks of a mountain with the wretched spells you seek carved into its walls. Its there the Darkhold was transcribed. Mount Wundagore.
Wanda,Wundagore.
Wong,No one has survived the journey.
Wanda,Perhaps we will be the exception.
America,Hey. Hey. This universe sucks.
Strange,"Cloak. Hey. Hey, Labcoat. Where the hell are we. Look, I dont know who you are or what you think youre trying to do here, but. These situations dont usually work out well for a nameless scientist, so just. Christine."
Christine 2,"Hello, Stephen."
America,"Ay, Dios."
Christine 2,"Miss Chavez. To answer your question, youre in a highly secure research facility. The two of you, along with your sentient cloak, are here for surveillance and testing."
Strange,Testing.
Christine 2,"Well, yes. Youre visitors from another universe. Your magnetic signatures could be radioactive. You may be carying diseases we just dont have treatments for. Hence these amazing polycarbonate fishbowls."
Strange,"Right. So, I have you to thank for these then."
Christine 2,"Yes, I developed those using the Sands of Nisanti. One of Stephens magical relics."
Strange,Stephen. Is that some kinda cyborg me.
Christine 2,Our universe is 838. And weve designated yours 616.
Strange,Oh. You guys sure must know a lot about the Multiverse. You got someone going around naming realities.
Christine 2,"Yes. Me. My senior phoned the Baxter Foundation, and I specialize in Multiversal research."
Strange,"So, howd you end up working here. Wherever here is."
Christine 2,"Oh, I volunteered. At your funeral."
Strange,Thank you for going.
Christine 2,"Your injuries, theyre. Theyre similar, but theyre not identical. Its fascinating."
Strange,"What were we, to each other in this universe."
Christine 2,We never quite figured that out.
Strange,"Yeah. Thats something we got in common. Christine. You gotta let us out of here. Everyones in real danger. Look, I know you dont know me."
Christine 2,"And I dont want to. Whatever I was to you, in your universe, does not matter."
Strange,Why not.
Christine 2,"Because youre dangerous, Stephen."
Strange,"Someone from my universe wants that girl. And shes gonna rip this place apart, atom by atom, until she gets what she wants. So I dont care, if youre from the Avengers, or S.H.I.E.L.D."
Mordo,Were neither.
Strange,"Well, what then. Hydra."
Mordo,"The Illuminati, will see you now."
Strange,The Illumi-whati. Dont let anyone hurt the kid. Its gonna be okay.
Wanda,You couldnt portal us up there.
Wong,"My magic can only take us so far. Masters of the Mystic Arts werent meant to tread upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore. Eons ago. The first demon, Chthon, carved his dark magic into this tomb. These same spells, were later transcribed into the Darkhold. Theres no telling what soulless monstrosities lie within."
Wanda,Theyve been waiting for me. This isnt a tomb. Its a throne.
Mordo,"Stephen Strange. You are now called before the Illuminati. I, Baron Karl Mordo, The Sorcerer Supreme, hereby."
Strange,Karl.
Mordo,Captain Carter. The First Avenger. Blackagar Boltagon. Keeper of the Terrigen Mists. The Inhuman King.
Strange,"Blackagar Boltagar. Hey-the-guy, hey-the-there."
Mordo,"Captain Marvel. Defender of the Cosmos. And the smartest man alive, Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four."
Reed,"Hello, Stephen."
Strange,Fantastic Four. Didnt you guys chart in the sixties.
Maria,Im sorry. Is this a joke to you.
Strange,"Well theres a guy over there with a fork on his head, so, yeah. Little bit."
Carter,Be grateful Black Bolt doesnt engage you in conversation.
Strange,Why. Does he have bad breath.
Carter,This Strange is even more arrogant than ours.
Strange,No. Just more alive.
Maria,For now.
Reed,"Stephen, your arrival here confuses and destabilizes reality. The larger the footprint you leave behind, the greater the risk of an incursion."
Strange,Incursion.
Reed,"An incusion occurs, when the boundary between two universes erodes, and they collide. Destroying one, or both, entirely."
Carter,"Your alternate self created the Illuminati, to make difficult decisions that no one else could. Today, were here to determine what to do with you, and the child."
Maria,"So, before we vote, if you got anything serious to say, nows the time."
Strange,"Yeah, I do. Its incursions youre worried about. Do you seriously think Im a bigger threat than the Scarlet Witch."
Maria,"Oh, we can handle your little witch if she decides to dreamwalk."
Strange,"No. No, you cannot, not unless you give me the Book of Vishanti."
Reed,"We appreciate your concern, Stephen, but its not the Scarlet Witch that we fear. From our experience, the greatest danger to the Multiverse, it turns out. is Doctor Strange."
Strange,Your Doctor Strange. Earths Mightiest Hero who died defeating Thanos.
Xavier,We should tell him the truth.
Mordo,Our final member. Professor Charles Xavier.
Strange,What truth.
Xavier,Thats not how our Strange died.
Wanda,Youre wondering what happens now.
Wong,"No. That I had already accepted. But I do wonder. When you can force America to send you to any universe you want, Why take her power for your own. You know it will k*ll her."
Wanda,"For Billy and Tommy. To protect them. What if they get sick. In the infinite Multiverse, theres a cure for every illness. A solution to every problem. I wont lose them again."
Wong,"Try as you might, Wanda, you cannot control everything."
Wanda,I can. Look at that view. Its carved in stone. I was meant to rule everything. But thats not what I want. I just want my boys.
Wong,"At the cost of a childs life. Is there no peace in knowing that, even though you cant be with the ones you love, there are worlds where you are together. Is that not enough."
Wanda,No.
Xavier,"Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos. We were at w*r. While the rest of us banded together to try to stop Thanos, Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone."
Mordo,He turned to the Darkhold. Began dreamwalking. In hopes that our salvation might lie in the Multiverse.
Maria,And guess what. It didnt. But he kept doing it anyway.
Reed,"One day, you called us all together, to profess that youve been dreamwalking. And in your words, things have gotten out of hand. You never told us the details of what had happened. Only that you had inadvertently triggered an incursion. You, our friend, had caused the annihilation of another universe."
Maria,Everyone in that reality died. Everyone.
Xavier,"Stephen renounced the Darkhold. He even helped us find the Book of Vishanti. A weapon we did use to k*ll him, to defeat Thanos. Thus, one final threat remained. I shall miss you, my friend."
Strange,Im ready.
Black Bolt,Im sorry.
Strange,Did you tell Christine.
Reed,Yes.
Strange,That statue. what about the statue. You built a statue.
Carter,"The world needs heroes. We made a difficult choice because we knew what our Strange was capable of. Or perhaps, every Doctor Strange is capable of."
Reed,The buildings been breached.
Strange,"No shit, genius."
Carter,"Status report, all sentries."
Maria,Shes headed for the child.
Carter,Watch him. Well vote on our return.
Xavier,"Stephen, should you manage to escape this chamber, you must guide America Chavez."
Mordo,What the hell are you saying.
Xavier,"Save the girl, and get to the Book of Vishanti."
Strange,"What, you have the book here."
Xavier,Yes. You built a way point.
Mordo,Charles. We cannot trust him.
Xavier,"I believe we can. Just cause someone stumbles and loses their way, doesnt mean theyre lost forever. We will see what kind of Doctor Strange you are."
Strange,Thank you.
Christine 2,Everybody out.
America,Its Wanda.
Automatic Voice,Ultron commander. Ultron command.
America,"Hurry up, Doc, shes coming."
Christine 2,"Oh, no."
Reed,"Wanda, stop. You possessed an innocent woman, but you can still do the right thing. Let her go. Please. I have children of my own. I understand your pain."
Wanda,Is their mother still alive.
Reed,Yes.
Wanda,Good. There will be someone left to raise them.
Reed,Wanda. Black Bolt can destroy you with one whisper from his mouth.
Wanda,What mouth.
Strange,Take me to the Book of Vishanti so that we can fight her together.
Mordo,You are in no position to give orders. My vote will conclude these proceedings when they return.
Wanda,Havent you had enough.
Carter,I can do this all day.
Maria,Get the hell out of my universe.
Strange,"Theyre not coming back. And you just cast your vote now to kill your friends. Not that that ever bothered you before. You know, you hated me where I came from. I bet secretly, my brother, you hated me here. You mustve been so jealous. Do you know what. I bet you were thrilled when you heard Ive been corrupted, hell, you probably gave me the Darkhold to begin with."
Mordo,"You know nothing, of this universe."
Strange,"I know, that killing Stephen Strange was your ticket to getting the Sanctum, to becoming Sorcerer Supreme, and to joining your little circus of clowns, the Illuminati."
Mordo,"Im ready. To cast my vote. Now. Die. I think Im beginning to understand, why your Mordo, didnt like you very much."
Christine 2,Youre sealed shut. Get back.
America,Whoa.
Xavier,Enough.
Wanda 2,Help me. Please.
Xavier,"Wanda Maximoff. Your mind is being held hostage by your alternate self. Grab my hand. If I can pull you from under the rubble, the spell should break."
Strange,Hey. You all right. You okay. You all right. Yeah.
America,She fixed him.
Strange,Thank you.
Christine 2,Yeah.
Strange,Xavier said I built a waypoint to the Book of Vishanti. Can you take us there.
Christine 2,How am I supposed to trust you.
Strange,"I know what happened. Im sorry for what he did. But believe me, the Book of Vishanti is the only way."
Christine 2,"Yeah. Your way. You sound a lot like my Stephen right now. He had to be the one holding the knife, and then that knife kept controlling people."
America,This Stephen is different. He is. It doesnt matter about all the other Stephens. Theyre not like him.
Strange,Smart kid.
Christine 2,Give me your hand. Do not make me regret this.
Strange,I wont.
America,"Okay, can we go now."
Christine 2,Follow me.
Strange,Where does that tunnel go.
Christine 2,Under the river.
Strange,"Go. Go, go, go."
Wanda,I warned you.
Strange,"Other Wanda, if youre in there, hold your breath."
America,Did it kill her.
Strange,"No, but it bought us some time."
Christine 2,The books through here. But only Stephens ever opened it.
Strange,"Shit. A chant only specific to me, something only I would know. Come on."
Christine 2,Stephen.
Strange,Come on.
Christine 2,Stephen.
Strange,Yeah. Thank you.
Christine 2,Sure.
Strange,"Open sesame. Come on, kid. You got this."
America,I got this.
Christine 2,Yeah.
Strange,Are you all right.
Christine 2,Yeah. This is the gap junction. The space between universes.
Strange,"All right, Book. Give me what I need."
Wanda 2,My boys.
America,This isnt what your children would want.
Wanda,Theyll never know.
America,Maybe not. But you will.
Strange,"Oh, no. Oh, crap."
Christine 2,"Its like, this reality collapsed in on itself."
Strange,Yeah. Two realities collided. Come on. America doesnt have long.
Christine 2,So where are we going.
Strange,"Well, if theres still a Sanctum in this universe, then there might be another, other, other me, and thats our best shoot at getting back to her. Well, I can see why you guys were so worried about incursions."
Christine 2,Whatever happened. this universes you didnt do a very good job of stopping it.
Strange,Ill tell him you said that. Hello.
Sinister Stephen Strange,Stop where you are. How did you get here.
Strange,By accident.
Sinister Stephen Strange,Who are you. what are you.
Strange,"Im just, one of us."
Sinister Stephen Strange,From the Multiverse.
Strange,Thats right.
Sinister Stephen Strange,Prove it.
Strange,"We had a sister. Donna. She, uh. She died, when we were kids."
Sinister Stephen Strange,How.
Strange,"We were. playing on a frozen lake, and. She fell through the ice. I couldnt save her."
Sinister Stephen Strange,"Sounds about right. But we dont talk about that, do we."
Strange,"No, we dont. I suppose your reality wasnt always like this."
Sinister Stephen Strange,"I suspect itd be somewhat like yours, until."
Strange,Until.
Sinister Stephen Strange,Until I lost.
Strange,To who.
Sinister Stephen Strange,What do you want.
Strange,I just want to get home.
Sinister Stephen Strange,"Yeah, believe me. Ive been trying to leave this place for a long time."
Strange,The Darkhold. You guard the Darkhold in this universe.
Sinister Stephen Strange,Yeah. For good reason.
Strange,Thats a start. I could use it. It could help me to communicate with my universe.
Sinister Stephen Strange,Careful. The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.
Strange,"I dont mean to be callous, but, how much of a heavier toll is there left to exact."
Sinister Stephen Strange,Not just on its reality. On its reader.
Strange,"Look, Im sorry you couldnt save your own universe, but maybe, you could help to save mine."
Sinister Stephen Strange,"Are you happy, Stephen."
Strange,What.
Sinister Stephen Strange,"Are you happy, Stephen. Its the question that. Christine Palmer asked me at her wedding. I said, yes, of course, Im happy. Im a sorcerer with the power of gods. What man wouldnt be happy. Then I, came back to this god darn haunted house. Sat down. and wondered why Id lied. I never meant for any of this to happen. I was looking for a world where things were different. Where I had Christine. Where I was. happy. But I didnt find it. All I found were more of us. So I did those Stephens a favor. You ever had that dream where youre falling, as if youve been pushed off a tall building. That was probably me. The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll."
Strange,"Okay. All the more reason to give it a rest, so let me have it."
Sinister Stephen Strange,Heres the deal. Ill let you use the Darkhold. if you give me your Christine.
Strange,Yeah. I dont think shes gonna go for that.
Sinister Stephen Strange,No. Didnt think so.
Strange,Hang on. Were coming.
Christine 2,What are you doing with the Darkhold. Are you going to dreamwalk.
Strange,Slightly more than just dreamwalking.
Christine 2,"All you Stranges, youre the same."
Strange,"I know. Youre right. We are all the same. But right now, that kid needs me, and I cant do any of this without your help. While Im under, I need you to protect my body, in case they attack me for trespassing."
Christine 2,Whos they.
Strange,The Souls of the Damned.
Christine 2,Okay. But doesnt a version of you need to live in that universe. So that you can dreamwalk into them.
Strange,Who said they have to be living.
Souls of the Damned,"Stephen Strange, possessing a dead body is forbidden. Cease your dreamwalk, and face the eternal consequences."
Christine 2,"Stephen. Dont let me go. Stephen. Hang on. Hang on, hang on. Brazier of BomGaliath. Go back to hell. Stephen. Ive got you. Youre a Master of the Mystic Arts. Theyre spirits. Use them. Use them. Use them."
Wong,Come on. Uh-oh. Strange.
Wanda,"Dreamwalking, you hypocrite."
Strange,"This time, its gonna take more than killing me to kill me."
Wong,I dont even wanna know. Shes breaking free.
Strange,Hold her.
Wong,Strange. Take Americas power. Theres no other way.
Strange,"Yeah. This is the only way. Its me, in other mes body."
America,"Youre gonna take my power, arent you. Before Wanda can. Its okay. I understand now."
Strange,"No, America. Ive come here to tell you to trust yourself, trust your power. Thats how we stop her."
America,I cant control it.
Strange,"Yes, you can. You have been all along. Every time you opened a portal, you sent us exactly where we needed to go."
America,What about the first time.
Strange,Even that led you to this moment. You are gonna kick that witchs ass.
Christine 2,Ive got you.
Wanda,Uh-huh.
America,I cant b*at you. So Ill give you what you want.
Wanda,Billy. Tommy.
Billy,Mommy.
Tommy,Theres a witch.
Wanda,What have you done.
Billy,Mommy.
Wanda 2,Wait. Boys. Its okay. Its okay. Its okay.
Wanda,Im their mother. Get away from them.
Strange,No. Not yet.
Tommy,Mommy.
Billy,Get away from our mom. Leave her alone.
Wanda,"Boys, stop. Please. Wait, boys. Stop. Stop it."
Billy,Please dont hurt us. Please.
Wanda,I would never hurt you. Never. I would never hurt anyone. Im not a monster. Im not. Im.
Tommy,Mom. Youre okay.
Wanda,"Okay, okay. Im okay."
Tommy,"Mom, no."
Billy,Dont go. Dont. Mom.
Wanda 2,Know that theyll be loved.
America,What now.
Strange,Get out of here.
America,Ill find you. We have to go. Now.
Wanda,I opened the Darkhold. I have to close it. No one will ever be tempted by the Darkhold again.
Strange,Are you all right.
Christine 2,Is it over.
Strange,Yeah.
Christine 2,Is America okay.
Strange,Shes on her way here to get us.
Christine 2,Wanda.
Strange,No. So she destroyed the Darkhold in every universe.
Christine 2,She did the right thing.
Strange,"Yes, she did."
Christine 2,Whats your universe like.
Strange,Its very beautiful. I wish I could show you.
Christine 2,Id really like that. But I. have to go.
Strange,"Yeah. Yeah, I know."
Christine 2,"Its too bad, though. Could have been one hell of an incursion."
Strange,"I love you. I love you in every universe. Its not that I dont wanna care for someone, or have someone care for me. Its just. I get scared."
Christine 2,Yeah. Face your fears. Doctor Strange.
America,How is this so much harder than a Multiversal portal.
Strange,"She needs to slow down, and be more patient."
Wong,Reminds me of another student I knew. How are you feeling.
Strange,Why do you ask.
Wong,You used the Darkhold to dreamwalk into your own corpse.
Strange,"Oh. Yeah, right, uh. Im fine. But I do wanna ask you something. Are you happy."
Wong,Thats a. interesting question.
Strange,"Youd think that saving the world would get you there, but. It doesnt."
Wong,"Sometimes, I do wonder. of my other lives. Yet I remain grateful in this one. Even with each tribulations."
Strange,Soon well have to go through a long one.
Wong,"No, we dont."
America,Wait. Sup.
Strange,Sup.
America Chavez,Made some sparks.
Doctor Stephen Strange,Great. Your parents would be proud. I hope youll get to show them one day.
America Chavez,Stephen. Im glad I found your universe.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"So am I, kid. So am I. Hmm."
Clea,Doctor Strange.
Docotr Stephen Strange,Can I help you.
Clea,"You caused an Incursion, and we’re gonna fix it. Unless you’re afraid."
Doctor Stephen Strange,Not in the least.
Pizza Poppa,It’s over.
