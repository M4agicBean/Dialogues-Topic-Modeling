You can come tuck me in if you want.,"00:19:01,598 "," 00:19:03,684"

 Eventually. Hmm.,"00:19:43,932 "," 00:19:45,309"
 Smells... Sweet.,"00:19:51,899 "," 00:19:53,400"
I was gonna say real.,"00:19:53,942 "," 00:19:55,527"
"Oh, it's all very real, thanks.","00:19:56,028 "," 00:19:58,197"

"But you put things right in the end,and that was never in doubt.","00:20:12,920 "," 00:20:16,673"
I'm not here to talk about Westview.,"00:20:16,840 "," 00:20:19,718"
Then what are you here for?,"00:20:19,927 "," 00:20:20,987"
We need your help.,"00:20:21,011 "," 00:20:22,262"
With what?,"00:20:25,140 "," 00:20:26,308"
What do you know about the Multiverse?,"00:20:26,475 "," 00:20:28,477"
The Multiverse.,"00:20:28,644 "," 00:20:30,270"
Vis had his theories.,"00:20:30,437 "," 00:20:31,521"
"He believed it was real,and dangerous.","00:20:31,605 "," 00:20:35,609"
"Well, he was right about both.","00:20:35,776 "," 00:20:37,277"
"We found a girlwho can somehow travel across it,","00:20:37,861 "," 00:20:40,656"
but she's being pursued.,"00:20:40,739 "," 00:20:42,282"
 Pursued by who? Some kind of demon.,"00:20:42,366 "," 00:20:43,992"
 One that covets her power for itself. Ah.,"00:20:44,076 "," 00:20:46,078"
"We've taken her to KamarTaj,and we've got our defenses,","00:20:46,787 "," 00:20:50,582"
but we could use an Avenger.,"00:20:50,666 "," 00:20:52,459"
There are other Avengers.,"00:20:52,626 "," 00:20:54,336"
"Yeah, but given the choicebetween the archer with the mohawk","00:20:54,419 "," 00:20:57,089"
"and several bugthemed crime fighters,","00:20:57,172 "," 00:20:59,341"
or one of the most powerfulmagicwielders on the planet...,"00:20:59,424 "," 00:21:04,346"
...it's an easy call.,"00:21:04,513 "," 00:21:05,847"
Come to KamarTaj.,"00:21:06,598 "," 00:21:08,100"
It'll get you back on the lunch box.,"00:21:09,685 "," 00:21:11,478"
What if you brought America here?,"00:21:14,481 "," 00:21:16,608"
Here?,"00:21:17,693 "," 00:21:18,694"
"Yeah. I know what it's liketo be on your own,","00:21:19,278 "," 00:21:22,114"
"hunted for abilities you never wanted,","00:21:22,197 "," 00:21:24,783"
and I can protect her.,"00:21:25,742 "," 00:21:27,369"
"You never told me her name, did you?","00:21:33,792 "," 00:21:34,894"
No.,"00:21:34,918 "," 00:21:35,961"
" Mm. No, I didn't.","00:21:37,296 "," 00:21:38,755"
"You know, the Hex was the easy part.","00:21:43,593 "," 00:21:45,554"
"The lying, not so much.","00:21:46,346 "," 00:21:49,266"
The Darkhold.,"00:22:16,335 "," 00:22:17,419"
You're familiar with the Darkhold?,"00:22:17,586 "," 00:22:18,962"
"I know it's the Book of the Damned,","00:22:19,129 "," 00:22:20,964"
and that it corrupts everythingand everyone that it touches.,"00:22:21,131 "," 00:22:24,551"
I wonder what it's done to you.,"00:22:24,718 "," 00:22:26,345"
The Darkhold only showed me the truth.,"00:22:26,511 "," 00:22:28,889"
Everything I lost can be mine again.,"00:22:29,056 "," 00:22:32,684"
What do you want with America?,"00:22:32,851 "," 00:22:34,394"
What do you want with the Multiverse?,"00:22:34,478 "," 00:22:36,438"
I'm going to leave this reality,"00:22:36,605 "," 00:22:38,899"
and go to one where I can bewith my children.,"00:22:39,691 "," 00:22:42,152"
"Wanda, your children aren't real.","00:22:42,319 "," 00:22:44,613"
You created them using magic.,"00:22:44,780 "," 00:22:46,823"
That's what every mother does.,"00:22:46,990 "," 00:22:48,617"
If you knew,"00:22:51,411 "," 00:22:53,163"
there was a universe,"00:22:53,747 "," 00:22:56,166"
"where you were happy,","00:22:56,333 "," 00:22:58,043"
wouldn't you want to go there?,"00:22:58,210 "," 00:23:00,170"
I am happy.,"00:23:00,629 "," 00:23:02,172"
I know better than mostwhat selfdeception looks like.,"00:23:02,339 "," 00:23:05,092"
"What you're doing is a flagrant violationof every natural law,","00:23:06,468 "," 00:23:09,429"
"and if you take that child's power,","00:23:09,513 "," 00:23:11,306"
she won't survive.,"00:23:11,390 "," 00:23:12,391"
"I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.","00:23:12,557 "," 00:23:14,684"
But she's not a child.,"00:23:15,519 "," 00:23:17,020"
She's a supernatural being.,"00:23:17,187 "," 00:23:19,356"
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this,"00:23:19,523 "," 00:23:22,109"
and other worlds.,"00:23:22,192 "," 00:23:23,402"
Her sacrifice,"00:23:23,568 "," 00:23:24,986"
would be for the greater good.,"00:23:26,071 "," 00:23:27,280"
"Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye,","00:23:27,364 "," 00:23:28,966"
'cause that's the kind of justificationour enemies use.,"00:23:28,990 "," 00:23:31,743"
Is it the one you used,"00:23:31,827 "," 00:23:33,328"
when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?,"00:23:34,037 "," 00:23:36,415"
"That was a war,and I did what I had to do.","00:23:39,918 "," 00:23:43,630"
You break the rules and become a hero.,"00:23:43,797 "," 00:23:46,091"
"I do it, and I become the enemy.","00:23:46,258 "," 00:23:48,176"
That doesn't seem fair.,"00:23:49,511 "," 00:23:51,096"
What happens now?,"00:23:52,722 "," 00:23:54,141"
Return to KamarTaj,"00:23:54,349 "," 00:23:55,934"
and prepare to hand overAmerica Chavez by sundown.,"00:23:56,101 "," 00:23:59,229"
Peacefully.,"00:24:00,480 "," 00:24:01,565"
After that...,"00:24:02,774 "," 00:24:03,984"
You'll never see me again.,"00:24:06,027 "," 00:24:08,447"
And if we don't?,"00:24:12,242 "," 00:24:13,743"
Then it won't be Wandawho comes for her.,"00:24:18,248 "," 00:24:20,542"
It will be the Scarlet Witch.,"00:24:21,751 "," 00:24:23,753"
The Scarlet Witch.,"00:24:34,264 "," 00:24:35,891"
Wanda's gone.,"00:24:38,935 "," 00:24:40,228"
"She's got the Darkhold,and the Darkhold has her.","00:24:40,896 "," 00:24:43,565"
The Scarlet Witch isa being of unfathomable magic.,"00:24:47,235 "," 00:24:50,322"
"She can rewrite reality as she chooses,","00:24:51,364 "," 00:24:53,700"
and is prophesized to either rule,"00:24:55,202 "," 00:24:57,662"
or annihilate the cosmos.,"00:24:57,829 "," 00:24:59,831"
She took over a whole town using her mind.,"00:24:59,998 "," 00:25:03,168"
"If she gets America's power,","00:25:04,544 "," 00:25:07,130"
she could enslave the entire Multiverse.,"00:25:07,297 "," 00:25:09,633"
"So, the person you went to ask for help,","00:25:11,551 "," 00:25:14,346"
"and told exactly where I am,","00:25:14,513 "," 00:25:16,723"
is the person that's trying to kill me?,"00:25:16,890 "," 00:25:18,450"
Yeah.,"00:25:19,809 "," 00:25:20,852"
Suspend teaching at onceand arm the students.,"00:25:21,561 "," 00:25:25,148"
KamarTaj must now become a fortress.,"00:25:25,315 "," 00:25:27,859"
Wow.,"00:26:03,061 "," 00:26:04,187"
It's the masters of the Hong Kongand London Sanctums.,"00:26:04,354 "," 00:26:06,815"
It's an honor to court deathalongside you once again.,"00:26:07,983 "," 00:26:11,111"
The honor is ours.,"00:26:11,444 "," 00:26:12,445"
"Whatever theSorcerer Supreme asks of us,","00:26:12,529 "," 00:26:15,031"
it shall be done.,"00:26:15,115 "," 00:26:16,533"
"Extra duty men,follow me.","00:26:17,075 "," 00:26:18,702"
It's ancient custom.,"00:26:19,119 "," 00:26:20,912"
Choose your words wisely.,"00:27:23,600 "," 00:27:25,602"
The fate of the Multiversemay depend on it.,"00:27:25,769 "," 00:27:28,063"
Got it.,"00:27:28,229 "," 00:27:29,272"
"No pressure, then.","00:27:30,523 "," 00:27:31,983"
All this for a child you met yesterday.,"00:27:45,163 "," 00:27:48,291"
"Wanda, you are justifiably angry.","00:27:48,458 "," 00:27:51,211"
You had to make terrible sacrifices.,"00:27:51,419 "," 00:27:53,380"
"I blew a hole through the headof the man I loved,","00:27:53,463 "," 00:27:56,174"
and it meant nothing.,"00:27:57,509 "," 00:28:00,303"
"Do not speak to me of sacrifice,Stephen Strange.","00:28:00,470 "," 00:28:04,432"
"If you give me what I want,","00:28:12,440 "," 00:28:15,485"
I'll send you to a world whereyou can be with Christine.,"00:28:15,652 "," 00:28:18,321"
The full might of KamarTajstands against you.,"00:28:20,657 "," 00:28:24,244"
"Defensive positions, now!","00:28:25,161 "," 00:28:28,164"
Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.,"00:28:34,754 "," 00:28:37,090"
You have no ideajust how reasonable I have been.,"00:28:37,173 "," 00:28:40,677"
Yeah.,"00:28:40,760 "," 00:28:41,761"

I don't exactly call thatbeing reasonable.,"00:28:45,140 "," 00:28:47,475"
Sending those creaturesafter her instead of myself,"00:28:47,559 "," 00:28:50,103"
was mercy.,"00:28:50,186 "," 00:28:51,688"
"And in spite of your hypocrisies,and insults,","00:28:52,522 "," 00:28:56,568"
I have begged youto safely get out of my way.,"00:28:56,651 "," 00:29:00,739"

She's using the reflections.Cover them.,"00:34:17,263 "," 00:34:19,098"
You gave all those lives,"00:34:51,339 "," 00:34:53,049"
just to keep me from my children.,"00:34:53,132 "," 00:34:55,843"
You took those lives.,"00:34:56,010 "," 00:34:57,428"

"I'm not a monster, Stephen.","00:35:00,973 "," 00:35:02,725"
I'm a mother.,"00:35:03,434 "," 00:35:04,477"
"Wanda, you have no children.","00:35:04,560 "," 00:35:06,437"
They don't exist.,"00:35:07,563 "," 00:35:08,689"
