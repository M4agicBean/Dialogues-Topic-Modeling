When I have a betterindication of what's going on.,"00:00:16,480 "," 00:00:18,456"
Mommy?,"00:00:18,480 "," 00:00:19,480"

No. I don't want you to go.,"00:00:31,240 "," 00:00:33,357"
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.,"00:00:33,760 "," 00:00:36,559"
I won't be able to keep my...,"00:00:36,760 "," 00:00:38,240"

tucked you backinto your bed...,"00:00:54,920 "," 00:00:56,991"
but too many liveswere at stake.,"00:00:57,440 "," 00:01:00,433"
"Oh, my God.","00:01:04,240 "," 00:01:05,640"

"To disarm the missile,we had to get inside it...","00:01:18,720 "," 00:01:21,872"
but the plating was too thick.,"00:01:22,040 "," 00:01:24,839"
The only way in was to shrinkbetween the molecules.,"00:01:25,000 "," 00:01:27,913"
I can't get through.,"00:01:31,360 "," 00:01:32,840"

"It should have been me,but my regulator was damaged.","00:01:41,880 "," 00:01:45,669"

Tell Hope I love her.,"00:01:50,040 "," 00:01:51,997"

She went subatomicto deactivate the bomb.,"00:01:55,520 "," 00:01:57,512"
Your mother savedthousands of lives that day,"00:02:02,600 "," 00:02:06,389"
knowing she'd be lostin the quantum realm.,"00:02:06,600 "," 00:02:10,037"
Alone.,"00:02:11,280 "," 00:02:12,280"
Afraid.,"00:02:12,800 "," 00:02:13,800"
Gone forever.,"00:02:14,720 "," 00:02:16,439"
Telling you that she wasn'tcoming home...,"00:02:31,520 "," 00:02:34,160"
was the hardest thingthat I ever had to do.,"00:02:34,920 "," 00:02:37,594"

"you show any hesitationor fear, we're done.","00:04:21,520 "," 00:04:23,716"

Snap your fingers. That getsthem to look over there.,"00:10:30,280 "," 00:10:33,159"
And that is misdirection.,"00:10:33,360 "," 00:10:35,158"
We had a dream,"00:10:38,880 "," 00:10:40,280"
We'd go travelin' together,"00:10:40,360 "," 00:10:41,953"
We'd spread a little lovin'then we'd keep movin' on,"00:10:42,160 "," 00:10:45,198"
Easypeasy.,"00:11:14,360 "," 00:11:17,319"
Where are you?,"00:11:24,320 "," 00:11:25,834"
Everythingthat you know...,"00:11:34,160 "," 00:11:36,516"
Lost...,"00:11:40,240 "," 00:11:41,515"
in the quantum realm.,"00:11:41,720 "," 00:11:44,076"
What?,"00:11:51,280 "," 00:11:52,794"
"I'm gonna find you,Jellybean.","00:11:53,080 "," 00:11:55,231"
I found you!,"00:12:01,040 "," 00:12:02,394"
"You always find me, Mommy.","00:12:02,520 "," 00:12:04,989"
What the hell?,"00:12:05,480 "," 00:12:07,392"
"Hey, Hank!It's been a while.","00:12:22,160 "," 00:12:24,436"
"Um, I don't even know ifthis is your number anymore.","00:12:25,360 "," 00:12:29,070"
And I'm probablythe last person,"00:12:29,240 "," 00:12:30,594"
you wanna hear from.,"00:12:30,680 "," 00:12:32,239"
But I just hada really weird dream.,"00:12:33,360 "," 00:12:35,556"
And I know that doesn't,"00:12:35,720 "," 00:12:36,836"
sound like an emergencyor anything...,"00:12:36,920 "," 00:12:38,216"
but it just felt very real.,"00:12:38,240 "," 00:12:42,393"
I was backin the quantum realm...,"00:12:43,000 "," 00:12:46,038"
and I think I saw your wife.,"00:12:46,240 "," 00:12:49,233"
And then I was your wife.,"00:12:49,400 "," 00:12:51,357"
"I mean, not in a weird wayor anything.","00:12:51,520 "," 00:12:54,354"
"You know,hearing this out loud,","00:12:56,560 "," 00:12:58,870"
"I'm thinking, uh,it's not an emergency.","00:12:58,960 "," 00:13:01,316"
I'm sorry to bother you.,"00:13:01,480 "," 00:13:03,472"
I'm sorry for a lot of things.,"00:13:04,760 "," 00:13:07,116"
"That means, one tiny atomin my fingernail could be...","00:13:16,120 "," 00:13:19,397"
"Could be one,little, tiny universe.","00:13:20,560 "," 00:13:24,793"
Hope?,"00:13:58,720 "," 00:13:59,720"
Is this another dream?,"00:14:01,960 "," 00:14:03,360"
Do you think it was a dream...,"00:14:03,520 "," 00:14:04,696"
or is it possible that youreally saw my mom down there?,"00:14:04,720 "," 00:14:07,315"
I'm not sure.,"00:14:08,000 "," 00:14:09,480"
I can't be here!,"00:14:12,960 "," 00:14:14,280"
I can't be here!I'm under house arrest!,"00:14:14,360 "," 00:14:16,079"
"They won't open whilethe system's engaged, Scott.","00:14:16,240 "," 00:14:19,074"
You have to take me home.They could show up any second!,"00:14:38,840 "," 00:14:41,674"
"Relax. As far as yournanny cops know,","00:14:41,840 "," 00:14:43,016"
you're still at home.,"00:14:43,040 "," 00:14:44,156"
Whoa!,"00:14:50,960 "," 00:14:52,314"
Scotty?,"00:14:58,160 "," 00:14:59,160"
He's programmed toreplicate your daily routine.,"00:14:59,320 "," 00:15:01,296"
9 hours in bed.,"00:15:01,320 "," 00:15:02,674"
5 hours in front of the TV.,"00:15:02,880 "," 00:15:04,080"
"2 hours in the bathroom,whatever that's about.","00:15:04,160 "," 00:15:06,277"
That's totally inaccurate.,"00:15:06,440 "," 00:15:07,874"
And how do you knowabout my daily routine?,"00:15:08,040 "," 00:15:09,720"
Are you spying on me?,"00:15:09,760 "," 00:15:10,796"
"We keep tabs on allsecurity threats, all right?","00:15:10,960 "," 00:15:12,776"
And so far the biggest onewe've had is you.,"00:15:12,800 "," 00:15:14,837"
I'm sorry about Germany.They just showed up.,"00:15:17,880 "," 00:15:20,270"
They said it wasa matter of national security.,"00:15:20,480 "," 00:15:22,320"
"That Cap needed help, so...","00:15:22,440 "," 00:15:23,669"
Cap?,"00:15:23,840 "," 00:15:25,069"
Tain America.Captain. Cap.,"00:15:25,960 "," 00:15:28,953"
It's what we call him.,"00:15:29,120 "," 00:15:30,918"
If you're a friend.,"00:15:31,400 "," 00:15:32,550"
"I'm not saying I'm a friendof... A little, I know him.","00:15:32,720 "," 00:15:33,976"
He's nice. Whatever.,"00:15:34,000 "," 00:15:35,036"
I'm sorry! All right?I didn't think I'd get caught.,"00:15:35,680 "," 00:15:38,195"
You didn't thinkabout a lot of things.,"00:15:38,360 "," 00:15:39,880"
How's Hank?,"00:15:41,320 "," 00:15:42,470"
"We're still running. The houseis gone, so is our freedom.","00:15:42,640 "," 00:15:44,776"
How do you think he is?,"00:15:44,800 "," 00:15:46,029"
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.,"00:15:46,200 "," 00:15:48,032"
"I'm not lookingfor an apology, Scott.","00:15:48,200 "," 00:15:49,680"
The only reasonwhy we're even talking is...,"00:15:49,840 "," 00:15:51,560"
because we needwhat's in your head.,"00:15:51,600 "," 00:15:53,193"
Is this where you're living?,"00:16:32,040 "," 00:16:33,952"
"If you need help or moneyor something, maybe I can...","00:16:34,600 "," 00:16:38,355"
We're fine.,"00:16:38,520 "," 00:16:39,874"
"Hey, Hank.Look, I just wanna...","00:17:37,040 "," 00:17:39,191"
Save it!,"00:17:39,760 "," 00:17:41,194"
 Can we start? Yeah.,"00:17:44,560 "," 00:17:45,710"
"So, while you were relaxingat home...","00:17:47,000 "," 00:17:49,231"
we were building this.,"00:17:49,400 "," 00:17:51,756"
It's a tunnel.To the quantum realm.,"00:17:52,720 "," 00:17:54,757"
To my mom.,"00:17:55,800 "," 00:17:57,029"
We think she might stillbe down there.,"00:17:57,200 "," 00:17:58,376"
We just don't know where.,"00:17:58,400 "," 00:17:59,400"
What?,"00:17:59,560 "," 00:18:00,560"
If we can pinpointmy mom's location...,"00:18:01,080 "," 00:18:03,072"
then the pod can take me downto get her.,"00:18:03,240 "," 00:18:05,152"
You built all thisand you don't even know,"00:18:05,320 "," 00:18:06,656"
if she's alive?,"00:18:06,680 "," 00:18:07,875"
It's called a hypothesis.,"00:18:08,040 "," 00:18:09,952"
"Last night, we powered upthe tunnel for the first time.","00:18:10,120 "," 00:18:12,840"
It was overloadedand it shut down.,"00:18:13,000 "," 00:18:15,117"
"But for a split second,","00:18:15,320 "," 00:18:16,879"
the doorway to thequantum realm was opened.,"00:18:16,960 "," 00:18:19,919"
And?,"00:18:20,800 "," 00:18:21,870"
"And 5 minutes later,you called, talking about Mom.","00:18:22,040 "," 00:18:25,158"
"We thinkwhen you were down there,","00:18:26,080 "," 00:18:27,136"
you may have entangledwith her.,"00:18:27,160 "," 00:18:28,514"
"Hank, I would never do that.I respect you too much.","00:18:28,680 "," 00:18:30,720"
"Quantum entanglement, Scott.","00:18:30,920 "," 00:18:33,071"
We think she might have put,"00:18:33,280 "," 00:18:34,475"
some kind of a messagein your head.,"00:18:34,560 "," 00:18:35,936"
"Hopefully, a location.","00:18:35,960 "," 00:18:37,758"
And opening the tunneltriggered it.,"00:18:37,920 "," 00:18:39,513"
Your mom put a messagein my head?,"00:18:39,720 "," 00:18:41,279"
Come on. That's insane.,"00:18:41,360 "," 00:18:42,999"
"No, Scott.","00:18:43,160 "," 00:18:44,196"
Insane is going to Germany,"00:18:44,360 "," 00:18:46,716"
"without telling us,and fighting the Avengers.","00:18:46,800 "," 00:18:49,156"
Just tell me you weren't lyingabout the suit you took.,"00:18:49,320 "," 00:18:52,438"
Tell meyou really destroyed it.,"00:18:52,600 "," 00:18:55,399"
"I did, I destroyed it,I swear.","00:18:55,560 "," 00:18:57,756"
I can't believeyou destroyed my suit!,"00:18:57,920 "," 00:18:59,798"
That was my life's work!,"00:19:00,760 "," 00:19:02,319"
What was I supposed to do?,"00:19:02,480 "," 00:19:03,709"
You were supposed to nottake my suit!,"00:19:03,880 "," 00:19:06,634"
"I'm sorry, Hank!","00:19:06,800 "," 00:19:07,800"
I'm sorry I took the suit.,"00:19:08,000 "," 00:19:09,354"
I'm sorrythat I called last night.,"00:19:09,440 "," 00:19:11,636"
I don't rememberseeing Janet down there.,"00:19:11,800 "," 00:19:13,816"
I wish that I did.,"00:19:13,840 "," 00:19:15,035"
I just had a dream about her,"00:19:15,200 "," 00:19:16,111"
playing hideandseekwith a little girl.,"00:19:16,200 "," 00:19:17,800"
What?,"00:19:21,200 "," 00:19:22,200"
I had a dream.,"00:19:24,840 "," 00:19:26,274"
She was playing hideandseekwith a little girl.,"00:19:26,440 "," 00:19:29,080"
Cassie and I do itall the time.,"00:19:29,240 "," 00:19:31,038"
Doesn't mean anything.,"00:19:31,120 "," 00:19:32,395"
But was it Cassiein the dream?,"00:19:32,560 "," 00:19:34,517"
No.,"00:19:34,680 "," 00:19:35,750"
Where was she hiding?,"00:19:35,920 "," 00:19:37,036"
 What? The little girl.,"00:19:37,200 "," 00:19:38,554"
Where was she hiding?Was it in a wardrobe?,"00:19:38,720 "," 00:19:40,757"
"No, it was in a tall dresser.","00:19:41,520 "," 00:19:44,035"
You mean a wardrobe.,"00:19:44,240 "," 00:19:45,356"
Is that what that's called?,"00:19:45,520 "," 00:19:46,636"
What color was it?,"00:19:47,000 "," 00:19:48,480"
Red.,"00:19:49,240 "," 00:19:50,240"
Were there horses on it?,"00:19:52,320 "," 00:19:53,800"
"Oh, boy.","00:19:54,360 "," 00:19:55,476"
It's where I hidevery time that we played.,"00:19:56,600 "," 00:19:59,513"
It doesn't sound like,"00:20:00,080 "," 00:20:01,196"
you really got the gistof the game.,"00:20:01,280 "," 00:20:03,317"
She's alive.,"00:20:05,080 "," 00:20:06,514"
I knew it.,"00:20:08,280 "," 00:20:09,919"
I knew it!,"00:20:10,840 "," 00:20:12,194"
We need to get that part.,"00:20:13,760 "," 00:20:15,114"
Okay.,"00:20:15,280 "," 00:20:16,475"
The sooner we getthe tunnel working...,"00:20:18,520 "," 00:20:19,896"
the sooner we can getthis message out of his head.,"00:20:19,920 "," 00:20:21,536"
Does Burch have it?,"00:20:21,560 "," 00:20:22,560"
 Yeah. Let's go. What part?,"00:20:22,720 "," 00:20:24,216"
Who's Burch?Wait. What's happening?,"00:20:24,240 "," 00:20:26,357"
We need a componentto stop the tunnel,"00:20:27,760 "," 00:20:29,319"
from overloading again.,"00:20:29,400 "," 00:20:30,914"
I grabbed your clothes.You might want to change.,"00:20:31,160 "," 00:20:33,675"
"Look, I'd really liketo help you...","00:20:43,200 "," 00:20:45,112"
but if I'm not at homewhen they come,"00:20:46,200 "," 00:20:47,336"
to take offmy ankle monitor...,"00:20:47,360 "," 00:20:48,560"
then I'm going away forever.,"00:20:48,600 "," 00:20:50,034"
Once we get the componentand power up the tunnel...,"00:20:50,200 "," 00:20:52,240"
"we'll get the message,and have you home by lunch.","00:20:52,320 "," 00:20:54,280"
We have to hurry.The entanglement won't last.,"00:20:54,320 "," 00:20:56,516"
You owe us.,"00:20:56,680 "," 00:20:57,680"
"All right, fine.But can I just wait inside?","00:20:58,360 "," 00:21:00,158"
Because I'm not supposedto be out here.,"00:21:00,360 "," 00:21:01,920"
Let's go.,"00:21:11,960 "," 00:21:13,314"
 We good? Yeah.,"00:21:30,800 "," 00:21:32,314"
I'll be right back.,"00:21:32,520 "," 00:21:34,034"
 Can I have one of these? No.,"00:21:41,400 "," 00:21:43,676"
Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui!,"00:21:57,920 "," 00:22:01,118"

Oui is Frenchfor yes.,"00:22:03,080 "," 00:22:04,912"
"As in yes to farmtotable,yes to locally sourced...","00:22:05,080 "," 00:22:07,320"
and yes to planetbefore profit.,"00:22:07,400 "," 00:22:09,995"
"Well, let's hopeit also means yes","00:22:11,160 "," 00:22:12,753"
to Do you have the componentI ordered?,"00:22:12,840 "," 00:22:14,440"
"You know, I have always lovedyour sense of humor, Susan.","00:22:16,880 "," 00:22:19,120"

"No, I'm good. Thank you.","00:22:20,520 "," 00:22:21,520"
Who is this guy?,"00:22:21,560 "," 00:22:22,835"
Sonny Burch. He trafficsin black market technology.,"00:22:23,000 "," 00:22:26,038"
He's been getting us whatwe need to build the tunnel.,"00:22:26,640 "," 00:22:28,760"
Could I just have one...,"00:22:31,120 "," 00:22:32,395"
No.,"00:22:32,560 "," 00:22:33,560"

And I say special...,"00:22:37,720 "," 00:22:38,870"

that I didn't previously know.,"00:22:41,960 "," 00:22:43,599"
For example...,"00:22:44,240 "," 00:22:45,879"
your name isn't Susan.,"00:22:46,040 "," 00:22:47,838"
It's Hope Van Dyne.,"00:22:48,000 "," 00:22:50,231"
"And your unseen associate,that's your father, Hank Pym.","00:22:50,760 "," 00:22:53,673"
" That's not good, Hank. No shit.","00:22:53,840 "," 00:22:55,957"

"Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRAdon't even exist anymore...","00:23:14,800 "," 00:23:16,736"
"but now, Hank Pym...","00:23:16,760 "," 00:23:18,672"
Hank Pymis a real opportunity.,"00:23:18,840 "," 00:23:21,196"
Do you have a point?,"00:23:21,360 "," 00:23:22,430"
"Oh, you thinkthat I don't know","00:23:22,600 "," 00:23:23,800"
what you've been buildingwith all this?,"00:23:23,880 "," 00:23:26,236"
Quantum technology.,"00:23:26,400 "," 00:23:28,392"
"Now, you can forget nanotech,forget AI,","00:23:28,920 "," 00:23:31,435"
forget cryptocurrency.,"00:23:31,520 "," 00:23:32,715"
Quantum energy is the future.,"00:23:32,880 "," 00:23:34,439"
It's the next gold rush.,"00:23:34,640 "," 00:23:36,313"
Is that so?,"00:23:36,480 "," 00:23:37,480"
"I want in, Hope.","00:23:37,640 "," 00:23:39,040"
"So, as a gesture of good will,I have taken the liberty...","00:23:39,200 "," 00:23:41,669"
of arranging some buyersfor your lab.,"00:23:41,840 "," 00:23:43,911"
Starting bid...,"00:23:44,560 "," 00:23:45,676"
one billion dollars.,"00:23:46,360 "," 00:23:49,432"
"Thank you, Sonny, really.","00:23:49,600 "," 00:23:51,193"
But my father and Ihave something,"00:23:51,360 "," 00:23:52,616"
slightly more pressingthan starting a business.,"00:23:52,640 "," 00:23:55,030"
So I'll just takethe component as arranged.,"00:23:55,240 "," 00:23:58,358"
My buyers don't take nofor an answer.,"00:23:58,520 "," 00:24:00,716"
"So, we areeither in business together...","00:24:02,160 "," 00:24:03,760"
or we aren'tin business together.,"00:24:04,120 "," 00:24:06,589"
Then I guess we aren't.,"00:24:09,480 "," 00:24:11,437"
You can go.,"00:24:11,600 "," 00:24:13,432"
But I'm afraid your money'sgonna have to remain.,"00:24:13,920 "," 00:24:16,355"
Let's call it compensationfor my injured feelings.,"00:24:16,720 "," 00:24:19,440"
"Listen, Sonny.","00:24:20,080 "," 00:24:21,594"
This is gonna beso much easier on everybody,"00:24:21,760 "," 00:24:24,514"
if you just give methat component.,"00:24:24,600 "," 00:24:26,114"
"Darlin', the only thingyou're takin' from here...","00:24:26,280 "," 00:24:28,240"
"is my heart,but it will mend in time.","00:24:28,360 "," 00:24:31,956"
Okay.,"00:24:33,600 "," 00:24:34,750"
"So, now what?","00:24:43,240 "," 00:24:44,674"
You'll see.,"00:24:44,840 "," 00:24:45,956"
She said her and her daddyhad something pressing.,"00:24:46,880 "," 00:24:48,736"
 Mmmhmm. I want to know what it is,"00:24:48,760 "," 00:24:49,936"
because if they're not workingwith us...,"00:24:49,960 "," 00:24:51,176"
they're working with somebody.So find out.,"00:24:51,200 "," 00:24:52,816"
I want some names...,"00:24:52,840 "," 00:24:53,956"
"Hold on, you gave her wings?","00:24:58,640 "," 00:25:00,393"
Get her.,"00:25:06,800 "," 00:25:07,800"
Not my turnofthecenturychandelier!,"00:25:23,840 "," 00:25:25,559"
Stop firing! Stop!,"00:25:30,040 "," 00:25:31,713"
"All right, take this.Go. Go, go, go!","00:25:36,320 "," 00:25:37,834"
Go!,"00:25:38,280 "," 00:25:39,430"
Wings and blasters.,"00:26:41,960 "," 00:26:43,599"
So I take it you didn't havethat tech available for me.,"00:26:43,760 "," 00:26:45,776"
"No, I did.","00:26:45,800 "," 00:26:46,800"
"It was a pleasure doingbusiness with you, Sonny.","00:26:48,720 "," 00:26:51,076"
"Oh, our businessisn't finished yet, Hope.","00:26:51,240 "," 00:26:53,709"
I can assure you of that!,"00:26:53,960 "," 00:26:55,553"
What in the hell is that?,"00:27:03,000 "," 00:27:04,878"
"Dad,are you seeing this?","00:27:18,760 "," 00:27:20,194"
"Hope, get out of there!","00:27:20,320 "," 00:27:21,320"
 I gotta do something. Wait!,"00:27:29,960 "," 00:27:31,553"
It is stilla work in progress.,"00:27:37,200 "," 00:27:40,193"
You taught methat kick. Remember?,"00:27:58,840 "," 00:28:00,096"
"Yeah, great form.","00:28:00,120 "," 00:28:01,315"
Those were the days.Whatever happened to us?,"00:28:01,520 "," 00:28:03,416"
"Not the time, Scott.","00:28:03,440 "," 00:28:04,640"
"Damn it, where'd it go?","00:28:05,040 "," 00:28:06,076"
I've lost it.,"00:28:09,080 "," 00:28:10,080"
I'm not seeing anythingon the ant cams.,"00:28:10,200 "," 00:28:12,000"
Try looking...,"00:28:12,080 "," 00:28:13,799"
Dad?,"00:28:14,200 "," 00:28:15,200"
Give me that.,"00:28:23,480 "," 00:28:25,278"
Now.,"00:28:25,360 "," 00:28:26,360"
 Are you okay? No!,"00:28:30,600 "," 00:28:32,080"
He got the lab.,"00:28:32,280 "," 00:28:33,280"
No.,"00:28:33,480 "," 00:28:34,197"
Come on!,"00:28:34,440 "," 00:28:35,440"
What was that?,"00:28:37,840 "," 00:28:38,956"
I don't know.,"00:28:39,160 "," 00:28:40,435"
But we need to find somewhereto regroup,"00:28:40,600 "," 00:28:42,432"
and figure outwhere the lab is.,"00:28:42,520 "," 00:28:44,352"
"So, where to now?","00:28:45,080 "," 00:28:46,309"
How about my house? Hmm?,"00:28:46,680 "," 00:28:48,319"
"I'm supposedto be there anyway,","00:28:48,480 "," 00:28:49,616"
and Woo could walk inany second.,"00:28:49,640 "," 00:28:50,816"
Exactly why we're not goingto your house.,"00:28:50,840 "," 00:28:53,071"
What about your house?,"00:28:53,240 "," 00:28:54,435"
Sorry.,"00:28:55,600 "," 00:28:57,319"
"Well, there is one placeI can think of.","00:28:57,480 "," 00:29:00,200"
No.,"00:29:01,120 "," 00:29:02,120"
"No, no, no, no!","00:29:02,560 "," 00:29:04,995"
No!,"00:29:06,720 "," 00:29:07,720"
"Wow, Dr. Pym...","00:29:11,120 "," 00:29:12,315"
"who would've thought that,","00:29:12,520 "," 00:29:13,840"
"once again,in your hour of need...","00:29:13,920 "," 00:29:15,280"
"that you would turn to us,you know?","00:29:15,360 "," 00:29:17,397"
Not me.,"00:29:17,600 "," 00:29:18,600"
Mmm. Help yourself.,"00:29:19,000 "," 00:29:20,878"
"Hey, what's upwith the fancy pastry?","00:29:21,040 "," 00:29:22,296"
We gotta keepthe food budget down.,"00:29:22,320 "," 00:29:23,680"
"Well, what are we supposedto have for breakfast?","00:29:23,800 "," 00:29:25,720"
The oatmeal packets.,"00:29:25,760 "," 00:29:26,796"
Oatmeal packets.,"00:29:26,920 "," 00:29:28,513"
 It's insult. Why is it an insult?,"00:29:28,680 "," 00:29:30,273"
Because it tastes like sand.,"00:29:30,440 "," 00:29:31,560"
You know why?'Cause it's organic.,"00:29:31,600 "," 00:29:33,096"
"It's not organic, it's sand.","00:29:33,120 "," 00:29:34,315"
It's the most important mealof the day.,"00:29:34,400 "," 00:29:35,736"
"You know what,you can get creative with it.","00:29:35,760 "," 00:29:36,557"
Break teeth.,"00:29:36,640 "," 00:29:37,676"
Put a little brown sugar onit. You can put some cinnamon.,"00:29:37,760 "," 00:29:39,136"
Put a little honey.Whatever you want...,"00:29:39,160 "," 00:29:40,336"
"Guys, guys, guys.Come on, man.","00:29:40,360 "," 00:29:43,239"
We got bigger fish to fry.,"00:29:43,400 "," 00:29:45,039"
Is that my desk?,"00:29:45,240 "," 00:29:46,674"
 Yeah. What?,"00:29:46,800 "," 00:29:48,393"
Why do I havesuch a small desk?,"00:29:48,640 "," 00:29:49,994"
Because you weren't therewhen we were choosing desks.,"00:29:50,160 "," 00:29:51,776"
"You snooze, you lose.","00:29:51,800 "," 00:29:52,800"
"Well, I wasunder house arrest.","00:29:53,000 "," 00:29:53,797"
Yeah.,"00:29:53,880 "," 00:29:54,631"
"You know what,this isn't even a desk.","00:29:54,720 "," 00:29:56,016"
This is garbage.,"00:29:56,040 "," 00:29:56,871"
You found this outsideamongst garbage.,"00:29:57,040 "," 00:29:59,680"
I got it at a rummage sale.,"00:29:59,800 "," 00:30:00,995"
"So, you save moneyon my desk?","00:30:01,160 "," 00:30:02,640"
Guys.,"00:30:02,800 "," 00:30:03,800"
"Hope, please,we need to focus, all right?","00:30:03,880 "," 00:30:05,917"
We gotta findthat lab already. Jeez.,"00:30:06,040 "," 00:30:08,271"
"Oh, you know what?I heard stories,","00:30:09,440 "," 00:30:10,800"
like what happened to you.,"00:30:10,880 "," 00:30:11,920"
"This crazy, creepy cat, whowalks through walls and stuff.","00:30:12,000 "," 00:30:14,176"
Like a ghost.,"00:30:14,200 "," 00:30:15,873"
Like Baba Yaga.,"00:30:16,080 "," 00:30:17,560"
"Baba Yaga, the witch.","00:30:20,640 "," 00:30:23,200"
They tell stories to childrento frighten them.,"00:30:23,320 "," 00:30:26,074"
You know Baba Yaga?,"00:30:27,320 "," 00:30:28,674"
Whoever stole it...,"00:30:29,720 "," 00:30:31,074"
we need to find it.,"00:30:31,280 "," 00:30:32,680"
"Oh, you don't find someonelike that. They find you.","00:30:32,840 "," 00:30:36,277"
Like Baba Yaga.,"00:30:36,600 "," 00:30:38,193"
"Dr. Pym, you're the smartestgenius I know.","00:30:38,720 "," 00:30:41,076"
Didn't you put some kind ofLoJack on your lab?,"00:30:41,200 "," 00:30:43,590"
"Because if you didn't,","00:30:43,800 "," 00:30:44,870"
we have a varietyof affordable options.,"00:30:44,960 "," 00:30:46,917"
"Of course I did, Luis.It was disabled.","00:30:47,080 "," 00:30:50,471"
Whoever stole the lab knewexactly what they were doing.,"00:30:50,600 "," 00:30:53,115"
They also looked likethey were phasing.,"00:30:53,320 "," 00:30:55,232"
Phasing?,"00:30:55,440 "," 00:30:56,440"
Quantum phasing.When an object moves,"00:30:56,600 "," 00:30:58,159"
through different statesof matter.,"00:30:58,240 "," 00:30:59,600"
"Oh, yeah,that's what I was thinking.","00:30:59,800 "," 00:31:01,473"
The lab emits radiation.,"00:31:01,600 "," 00:31:02,670"
Can we modify a quantumspectrometer and track it?,"00:31:02,880 "," 00:31:05,440"
"That could work, yes, but allmy equipment is in the lab.","00:31:05,600 "," 00:31:08,195"
Where else can we findthat equipment?,"00:31:08,360 "," 00:31:10,317"
"Well, there is one person.","00:31:12,320 "," 00:31:14,073"
Bill Foster.,"00:31:15,240 "," 00:31:16,435"
Great!,"00:31:16,640 "," 00:31:17,640"
Who's Bill Foster?,"00:31:17,840 "," 00:31:19,194"
"He's an old colleague ofmy dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.","00:31:19,360 "," 00:31:21,477"
They had a falling outyears ago.,"00:31:21,640 "," 00:31:23,359"
You seem to have a lot offalling outs with people.,"00:31:23,520 "," 00:31:25,376"
It's probablyjust a waste of time.,"00:31:25,400 "," 00:31:27,392"
"Hey, I'm risking everythingby being here.","00:31:27,520 "," 00:31:29,512"
Don't you thinkwe should check?,"00:31:29,640 "," 00:31:30,880"
We need to find outwho took the lab.,"00:31:31,080 "," 00:31:33,356"
"Guys,it's not a good idea","00:32:25,960 "," 00:32:27,360"
to be out in the openlike this.,"00:32:27,440 "," 00:32:28,874"
"Relax,no one's gonna recognize us.","00:32:29,040 "," 00:32:31,874"
"What, because of hatsand sunglasses?","00:32:32,200 "," 00:32:34,396"
"That's not a disguise, Hank.","00:32:34,560 "," 00:32:36,040"
We look like ourselvesat a baseball game.,"00:32:36,120 "," 00:32:38,316"
In an isolated system...,"00:32:38,480 "," 00:32:40,358"
particles coexist ina stable phase relationship.,"00:32:40,560 "," 00:32:45,077"
"If the systemis interfered with,","00:32:45,280 "," 00:32:47,431"
that stability becomes chaos.,"00:32:47,520 "," 00:32:50,718"
Unpredictable.,"00:32:50,840 "," 00:32:52,672"
Dangerous.Beautiful.,"00:32:52,840 "," 00:32:55,230"
"Isolated completely,a quantum system","00:32:55,840 "," 00:32:57,752"
would revert back toseparate states of matter...,"00:32:57,840 "," 00:33:00,196"
each entangled with a distinctstate of its environment.,"00:33:00,360 "," 00:33:03,990"
"In other words,the object in question","00:33:04,120 "," 00:33:06,680"
would be bothin and out of phase...,"00:33:06,760 "," 00:33:08,433"
with multipleparallel realities.,"00:33:08,600 "," 00:33:11,832"
Speaking of being out of phasewith reality.,"00:33:16,640 "," 00:33:20,350"
I am noticingan unusually high number,"00:33:20,480 "," 00:33:23,279"
of glazed eyes out thereamong you.,"00:33:23,360 "," 00:33:25,670"
"So, why don't we call ita few minutes early?","00:33:26,880 "," 00:33:29,714"
That'll be enough for today.,"00:33:29,880 "," 00:33:31,030"
"Thank you, ladiesand gentlemen, you may go.","00:33:31,120 "," 00:33:32,873"
It's incredible.You're linked to Janet.,"00:33:34,880 "," 00:33:37,634"
It's quantum entanglementbetween the quantum states of,"00:33:38,400 "," 00:33:40,756"
Posner moleculesin your brains.,"00:33:40,840 "," 00:33:42,638"
"Yeah, that's whatI was thinking.","00:33:42,840 "," 00:33:44,240"
Do you guysjust put the word quantum,"00:33:45,560 "," 00:33:46,391"
in front of everything?,"00:33:46,480 "," 00:33:47,480"
"Doctor, we need tofind our lab.","00:33:47,520 "," 00:33:49,239"
"Hope, I'd love to help you...","00:33:49,400 "," 00:33:50,754"
but I don't have anything,"00:33:51,000 "," 00:33:51,558"
like the equipmentyou're describing.,"00:33:51,640 "," 00:33:52,391"
"I told you this is a wasteof time. Come on, let's go.","00:33:52,560 "," 00:33:54,680"
"Don't condescend, Hank.","00:33:54,800 "," 00:33:55,960"
You're the one who'son the run from the FBI.,"00:33:56,120 "," 00:33:58,112"
All becauseyou had to grow to a size,"00:33:58,280 "," 00:34:00,112"
that finally fit your ego.,"00:34:00,200 "," 00:34:01,919"
That wasn't me in Germany.It was this idiot.,"00:34:02,080 "," 00:34:05,391"
Really?,"00:34:05,600 "," 00:34:06,600"
"Going that big,it must've been exhausting.","00:34:08,080 "," 00:34:10,151"
I slept for 3 daysstraight. You have no idea.,"00:34:10,360 "," 00:34:12,591"
"Actually, I do.","00:34:12,720 "," 00:34:13,836"
"Back in the day,I was Hank's partner","00:34:13,960 "," 00:34:15,713"
on a project called Goliath.,"00:34:15,800 "," 00:34:17,553"
Excuse me?You were my partner?,"00:34:17,720 "," 00:34:19,074"
The only thing more tiringthan going that big,"00:34:19,240 "," 00:34:21,197"
is putting upwith Hank's bullshit.,"00:34:21,280 "," 00:34:23,192"
Right...,"00:34:23,360 "," 00:34:24,720"
I don't know.How big did you get?,"00:34:26,240 "," 00:34:28,960"
My record? 21 feet.,"00:34:29,240 "," 00:34:31,880"
 Not bad. You?,"00:34:32,000 "," 00:34:33,434"
I don't...,"00:34:33,680 "," 00:34:34,431"
"No, really, I'm curious.","00:34:34,600 "," 00:34:35,600"
 65 feet. Yeah. Whoa!,"00:34:36,560 "," 00:34:38,233"
 Huge. 65.,"00:34:38,440 "," 00:34:40,079"
If you two are finishedcomparing sizes...,"00:34:40,240 "," 00:34:42,630"
we need to figure out a wayto track down the lab.,"00:34:42,760 "," 00:34:44,956"
And the great Hank Pym hasn'tfigured that one out yet?,"00:34:45,120 "," 00:34:48,113"
Strange.,"00:34:48,240 "," 00:34:49,959"

That's it.,"00:47:05,840 "," 00:47:07,069"
Dr. Foster did his bestto keep me safe.,"00:47:07,440 "," 00:47:10,114"
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.,"00:47:10,800 "," 00:47:12,280"
saw an opportunityin my affliction.,"00:47:12,360 "," 00:47:15,000"
"They built mea containment suit,","00:47:18,240 "," 00:47:19,833"
so I could control my phasing.,"00:47:19,920 "," 00:47:21,479"
And trained meto be a stealth operative.,"00:47:22,240 "," 00:47:23,959"

"I built the chamberto slow her decay,","00:47:46,040 "," 00:47:47,838"
but her conditionwas progressive.,"00:47:47,920 "," 00:47:49,216"
I didn't know how to cure it.,"00:47:49,240 "," 00:47:51,360"
"She wanted to kill you, Hank,but I told her no...","00:47:52,040 "," 00:47:54,714"
and that she shouldwatch you instead.,"00:47:54,880 "," 00:47:56,216"

that you werebuilding the tunnel.,"00:47:57,800 "," 00:47:59,120"

"For the last 30 years,she's been down there","00:49:02,480 "," 00:49:03,976"
absorbing quantum energy.,"00:49:04,000 "," 00:49:05,000"
We can extract that energy.,"00:49:05,160 "," 00:49:06,514"
We can use it to repairAva's molecular structure...,"00:49:06,680 "," 00:49:08,990"
Extract it?,"00:49:09,160 "," 00:49:09,991"
 Yes. Are you insane?,"00:49:10,160 "," 00:49:11,230"

to prepare I'd be more ready.,"00:50:51,360 "," 00:50:52,874"
"Oh, going subatomic isn'tsomething you can prepare for.","00:50:53,040 "," 00:50:55,953"

a known associateof Scott Lang...,"00:53:04,560 "," 00:53:06,199"
"a known associate of Hank Pym,who I've also learned...","00:53:06,360 "," 00:53:09,319"

How?,"00:54:38,720 "," 00:54:39,720"
"Lang. He hasa daughter, right?","00:54:40,880 "," 00:54:43,111"

Because I don't feel anything.,"00:55:40,840 "," 00:55:42,040"

"Well, see, that's complicated.","00:55:59,720 "," 00:56:00,920"
"Because when I first metScotty, he was in a bad place.","00:56:01,040 "," 00:56:02,976"
And I'm not talkin'about cell block D.,"00:56:03,000 "," 00:56:04,520"

" Lang! Right, right, right.","00:56:41,560 "," 00:56:42,789"

"You know what, girl?My heart is all broken.","00:56:50,840 "," 00:56:51,976"

but damnif I want to kiss you!,"00:56:53,120 "," 00:56:54,376"
But then you fast forward,"00:56:54,400 "," 00:56:55,400"
"and they're allinto each other, right?","00:56:55,440 "," 00:56:56,576"

It's shutting down.Maybe our vectors are off.,"00:59:54,440 "," 00:59:56,240"
"We've gone over them a milliontimes, I know they're right!","00:59:56,320 "," 00:59:58,640"

"Janet,how is this possible?","01:01:02,240 "," 01:01:04,755"
It wasn't a message you put,"01:01:06,280 "," 01:01:07,714"
in Scott's head.It was an antenna.,"01:01:07,800 "," 01:01:09,160"

Tell us how to find you.,"01:01:15,400 "," 01:01:16,959"
"No, the probability fieldsare too complex.","01:01:17,120 "," 01:01:18,952"
That's why I neededto talk to you.,"01:01:19,120 "," 01:01:20,480"
You have to follow my voice.,"01:01:20,640 "," 01:01:22,040"
Of course!,"01:01:22,480 "," 01:01:23,550"
Like tracing a callback to its source!,"01:01:23,720 "," 01:01:25,598"
I'm tracking your signalusing subatomic frequencies...,"01:01:30,560 "," 01:01:33,678"
between point 2and point 9.,"01:01:33,840 "," 01:01:36,116"
I'd narrow it to 4 and 6.,"01:01:36,280 "," 01:01:37,794"
That's too tight.We could miss you.,"01:01:38,000 "," 01:01:39,256"
Look at us squabbling again.,"01:01:39,280 "," 01:01:40,873"
"Fine. All right,between 3 and 7.","01:01:41,840 "," 01:01:44,435"

"In the wasteland,beyond the quantum void.","01:02:12,640 "," 01:02:15,155"
"It's very dangerous,","01:02:15,320 "," 01:02:16,470"
"especially on the human mind,so be careful.","01:02:16,560 "," 01:02:18,597"
Time and space work verydifferently down here.,"01:02:18,760 "," 01:02:21,320"
You have 2 hours.,"01:02:21,480 "," 01:02:22,880"
"After that, the probabilityfields will shift...","01:02:23,040 "," 01:02:24,856"
and it'll be another century,"01:02:24,880 "," 01:02:25,896"
before they alignlike this again.,"01:02:25,920 "," 01:02:27,354"
We'll find you.,"01:02:27,520 "," 01:02:29,512"

Perfect.,"01:02:46,600 "," 01:02:47,636"
How did we get up here?,"01:02:49,640 "," 01:02:51,120"
"All right, first you're gonnasee all kinds of lights...","01:02:56,040 "," 01:02:57,816"
and it's gonna getreally trippy...,"01:02:57,840 "," 01:02:59,136"
but then it's gonna turn blackand silent. Really silent.,"01:02:59,160 "," 01:03:01,880"
"Scott, I'll be fine.","01:03:02,080 "," 01:03:03,480"

"Uh, they gave mesome truth serum.","01:03:19,960 "," 01:03:21,256"
And then all of a sudden,"01:03:21,280 "," 01:03:22,077"
I started talkin'all honestly.,"01:03:22,160 "," 01:03:23,360"
"Like, I hate the waythat you load the dishwasher.","01:03:23,520 "," 01:03:25,176"
"I hate it, I hate it.","01:03:25,200 "," 01:03:26,429"
