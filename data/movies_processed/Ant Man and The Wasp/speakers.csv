Speaker,Line
Hank,I still think about the night your mother and I had to leave you.
Janet,"Hopefully, its not for long, but Ill call you when we get settled.When I have a better indication of whats going on."
Young Hope,Mommy.
Janet,"Oh, Jellybean. Daddy and I have a last minute business trip, so Rose is going to stay with you for a few days."
Young Hope,No. I dont want you to go.
Janet,Ugh. Its gonna be so boring. I wont be able to keep my. eyes.
Hank,"I wish we could have put down our bags, and tucked you back into your bed, but too many lives were at stake."
Hank,Oh my god. Theyve already launched.
Janet,We have to stop it. Come on.
Hank,"The only way to disarm the missile was to get inside it, but the plating was too thick. The only way in was to shrink between the molecules."
Janet,I cant get through. Hank.
Hank,"We both knew that if you go that small, theres no coming back."
Hank,"It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged. Your mothers wasnt."
Janet,Tell Hope I love her.
Hank,She turned it off.
Hank,"Janet, no."
Hank,
Hank,"Your mother saved thousands of lives that day, knowing shed be lost in the quantum realm. Alone. Afraid. Gone forever."
Hank,"Telling you that she wasnt coming home, was the hardest thing that I ever had to do."
Hank,"But then Scott showed up. Or should I say, broke into our house. And when he went to the quantum realm. and came back. Everything changed. I started to wonder. could your mother still be alive. So, I dusted off some old plans."
Hope,"Dad, what are you saying."
Hank,I think its possible to bring her back.
Scott,"Okay. Were in. Oh, this place is a maze. Wheres that map. Were definitely close. You ready."
Cassandra,"Im ready, Daddy."
Scott,"Are you sure. Cause once were inside, you show any hesitation or fear, were done."
Cassandra,I eat fear for breakfast.
Scott,"Wow. That is super cool. Come on. Look. Its Anton. Hell show us the way. Anton, which way do we go. Anton, which way do we go. Thanks, Anton. Look, the ants have burrowed into the tech facility."
Cassandra,"Oh no, lasers."
Scott,Oh. I think I got lased. The secret vault. Tell me you brought the contact lens.
Cassandra,Yup.
Scott,Perfect. Right there.
Cassandra,There. Its the micro-treasure.
Scott,My trophy.
Cassandra,It looks like treasure.
Scott,"Oh, it is to me."
Cassandra,I want to take it to show-and-tell.
Scott,"Oh, no, you cant do that. You cant. It never leaves the house. Its too important. This is the best birthday present you ever got me. Im so touched you think Im the worlds greatest grandma."
Cassandra,It was the only one they had.
Scott,It makes me want to knit you a sweater.
Cassandra,"Oh, no, the fuzz."
Luis,"Hey, Scotty. I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings. and I think we have way too many security cameras, dont we."
Scott,"No, no, not at all."
Luis,"I mean, cause its a lot of security cameras."
Scott,I know what he needs. Whos the security expert in our business.
Luis,"You are, but Im running the company, right. And if we overquote him. hes gonna go somewhere else. I mean, we gotta land this bird."
Scott,He aint goin anywhere. And the expression is land this fish.
Luis,"No, its land the bird. Just like you land the plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business."
Scott,"I know its silly to get hung up on these kinds of things, but I do."
Luis,"How am I gonna land a fish. It cant walk. And if it swam up on shore. and it battled a hawk, whos gonna win."
Scott,"Youve really turned me around on this thing. Its okay. Were gonna land Karapetyan. Now, if you just excuse me. Im in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter."
Luis,Im gonna go recheck it.
Cassandra,To the escape ant. Lets bounce before the po-po come back.
Luis,"The po-po. How do you even know that. Lets fly, Antoinette. Lets fly. Crash landing."
Cassandra,Whoo. I wish we could shrink for real.
Scott,Oh. That is pretty cool.
Luis,"Hey, Im headed to the office, Scotty. And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know. But I feel like Im way better. My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff. And my hands are shaking. But I think its unrelated, you know."
Scott,"Its gonna be great, Luis. You got nothing to worry about."
Luis,"Yeah, yeah. Im the boss. Im the boss. Im the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Cassandra,"Daddy. Come on, Woo. Ive got three days left. Why would I try to escape."
Woo,"Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules. You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place. Keel to stern, soup to nuts."
Scott,Thank you. It was an accident. My foot went through the fence.
Cassandra,Our flying ant crashed.
Scott,"Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old when you cant leave the house. You know the lengths that Ive gone to. Close-up magic. I learned that."
Cassandra,Why cant you just leave my daddy alone.
Woo,"Oh, Cassie. This must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh. Well, think of it this way. Your school has rules, right. Like, you cant draw on the walls. Well, your daddy went to Germany and drew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords. Now, as a part of his joint plea deal. with Homeland Security and the German government. he was allowed to return to the U.S. provided he serve two years under house arrest. followed by three years of probation. And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology. or contact with any former associates who were. or currently are in violation of said Accords. Or any related statutes. Okay, sweetie."
Scott,Wow. Youre really great with kids.
Woo,"Thanks. Im also a youth pastor. Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot. but you havent had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you."
Scott,No.
Woo,"You sure. Because its only a matter of time before we get em. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. And associating with them breaks your deal. And, uh, I dont need to remind you. that any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum."
Scott,I havent talked to Hank or Hope in forever.
Cassandra,They hate his guts.
Scott,"Thanks, peanut."
Woo,"Howd you do it, Scott."
Scot,Do what.
Woo,The card trick.
Scott,Seriously.
Maggie,"Oh, my God. You people cant just show up here whenever you want and search the place."
Paxton,"Actually, they can."
Maggie,You need a warrant.
Paxton,"Actually, they dont."
Maggie,Really. Wow. Did you pack your soccer shoes.
Cassandra,Yeah.
Maggie,All right. Next time I see you will be on the outside.
Paxton,"All right. Oh, get on the inside of this. Hey, three days. Seriously. Im proud of you, bud."
Scott,Thank you.
Paxton,You know what. Give me another one.
Maggie,Me too. Gosh. Freedom. New business. I am sensing greatness.
Cassandra,"I had a fun weekend, Daddy."
Scott,"Me too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend. Once Im outta here, you and I are gonna go paint this town red. Well have so much ice cream, well never stop puking."
Maggie,Youre gettin good at that.
Paxton,Howd you do that.
Cassandra,"Bye, Daddy."
Maggie,Bye.
Scott,Bye.
Cassandra,Bye.
Scott,Three days. Easy-peasy. We had a dream ♪ Wed go travelin together ♪ Wed spread a little lovin then wed keep movin on ♪ Easy-peasy.
Cassandra,Where are you.
Hank,Everything that you know. Lost. in the quantum realm.
Scott,What.
Janet,"Im gonna find you, Jellybean. I found you."
Hope,"You always find me, Mommy."
Scott,"What the hell. Hey, Hank. Its been a while. Um, I dont even know if this is your number anymore. And Im probably the last person you wanna hear from. But I just had a really weird dream. And I know that doesnt sound like an emergency or anything. but it just felt very real. I was back in the quantum realm. and I think I saw your wife. And then I was your wife. I mean, not in a weird way or anything. You know, hearing this out loud, Im thinking, uh, its not an emergency. Im sorry to bother you. Im sorry for a lot of things."
TV,"That means, one tiny atom in my fingernail could be. Could be one, little, tiny universe."
Scott,Hope. Is this another dream.
Hope,Do you think it was a dream. or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there.
Scott,Im not sure. I cant be here. I cant be here. Im under house arrest.
Hope,"They wont open while the systems engaged, Scott."
Scott,You have to take me home. They could show up any second.
Hope,"Relax. As far as your nanny cops know, youre still at home."
Luis,Whoa. Scotty.
Hope,"Hes programmed to replicate your daily routine. Nine hours in bed. Five hours in front of the TV. Two hours in the bathroom, whatever thats about."
Scott,Thats totally inaccurate. And how do you know about my daily routine. Are you spying on me.
Hope,"We keep tabs on all security threats, all right. And so far the biggest one weve had is you."
Scott,"Im sorry about Germany. They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security. That Cap needed help, so."
Hope,Cap.
Scott,"Tain America. Captain. Cap. Its what we call him. If youre a friend. Im not saying Im a friend of. A little, I know him. Hes nice. Whatever. Im sorry. All right. I didnt think Id get caught."
Hope,You didnt think about a lot of things.
Scott,Hows Hank.
Hope,"Were still running. The house is gone, so is our freedom. How do you think he is."
Scott,Im sorry. I know youre mad.
Hope,"Im not looking for an apology, Scott. The only reason why were even talking is. because we need whats in your head."
Scott,"Is this where youre living. If you need help or money or something, maybe I can."
Hope,Were fine.
Scott,"Hey, Hank. Look, I just wanna."
Hank,Save it. Can we start.
Hope,"Yeah. So, while you were relaxing at home. we were building this. Its a tunnel. To the quantum realm. To my mom. We think she might still be down there. We just dont know where."
Scott,What.
Hope,If we can pinpoint my moms location. then the pod can take me down to get her.
Scott,You built all this and you dont even know if shes alive.
Hank,"Its called a hypothesis. Last night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It was overloaded and it shut down. But for a split second, the doorway to the quantum realm was opened."
Scott,And.
Hope,"And five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom."
Hank,"We think when you were down there, you may have entangled with her."
Scott,"Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much."
Hank,"Quantum entanglement, Scott."
Hope,"We think she might have put some kind of a message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the tunnel triggered it."
Scott,Your mom put a message in my head. Come on. Thats insane.
Hank,"No, Scott. Insane is going to Germany without telling us, and fighting the Avengers. Just tell me you werent lying about the suit you took. Tell me you really destroyed it."
Scott,"I did, I destroyed it, I swear."
Hank,I cant believe you destroyed my suit. That was my lifes work.
Scott,What was I supposed to do.
Hank,You were supposed to not take my suit.
Scott,"Im sorry, Hank. Im sorry I took the suit. Im sorry that I called last night. I dont remember seeing Janet down there. I wish that I did. I just had a dream about her playing hide-and-seek with a little girl."
Hope,What.
Scott,I had a dream. She was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl. Cassie and I do it all the time. Doesnt mean anything.
Hope,But was it Cassie in the dream.
Scott,No.
Hope,Where was she hiding.
Scott,What.
Hope,The little girl. Where was she hiding. Was it in a wardrobe.
Scott,"No, it was in a tall dresser."
Hank,You mean a wardrobe.
Scott,Is that what thats called.
Hope,What color was it.
Scott,Red.
Hope,Were there horses on it.
Scott,"Oh, boy."
Hope,Its where I hid every time that we played.
Scott,It doesnt sound like you really got the gist of the game.
Hope,Shes alive.
Hank,I knew it. I knew it.
Hope,We need to get that part.
Hank,Okay.
Hope,The sooner we get the tunnel working. the sooner we can get this message out of his head.
Hank,Does Burch have it.
Hope,Yeah. Lets go.
Scott,What part. Whos Burch. Wait. Whats happening.
Hope,We need a component to stop the tunnel from overloading again. I grabbed your clothes. You might want to change.
Scott,"Look, Id really like to help you. but if Im not at home when they come to take off my ankle monitor. then Im going away forever."
Hope,"Once we get the component and power up the tunnel. well get the message, and have you home by lunch. We have to hurry. The entanglement wont last."
Hank,You owe us.
Scott,"All right, fine. But can I just wait inside. Because Im not supposed to be out here."
Hank,Lets go.
Hope,We good.
Hank,Yeah.
Hope,Ill be right back.
Scott,Can I have one of these.
Hank,No.
Sonny Burch,Ah. Susan. Welcome to Oui.
Hope,Sonny.
Sonny Burch,"Oui is French for yes. As in yes to farm-to-table, yes to locally sourced. and yes to planet before profit."
Hope,"Well, lets hope it also means yes to Do you have the component I ordered."
Sonny Burch,"You know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan. Have a seat."
Hope,"No, Im good. Thank you."
Scott,Who is this guy.
Hank,Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology. Hes been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.
Scott,Could I just have one.
Hank,No.
Sonny Burch,"You know, I have a special friend at the FBI. And I say special. because, well, he tells me things that I didnt previously know. For example. your name isnt Susan. Its Hope Van Dyne. And your unseen associate, thats your father, Hank Pym."
Scott,"Thats not good, Hank."
Hank,No shit.
Hope,What do you want.
Sonny Burch,"Relationships are built on trust, Hope. And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation."
Hope,Our relationship.
Sonny Burch,"My business landscape has been shifting, Hope. Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA dont even exist anymore. but now, Hank Pym. Hank Pym is a real opportunity."
Hope,Do you have a point.
Sonny Burch,"Oh, you think that I dont know what youve been building with all this. Quantum technology. Now, you can forget nanotech, forget AI, forget cryptocurrency. Quantum energy is the future. Its the next gold rush."
Hope,Is that so.
Sonny Burch,"I want in, Hope. So, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty. of arranging some buyers for your lab. Starting bid. one billion dollars."
Hope,"Thank you, Sonny, really. But my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business. So Ill just take the component as arranged."
Sonny Burch,"My buyers dont take no for an answer. So, we are either in business together. or we arent in business together."
Hope,Then I guess we arent.
Sonny Burch,You can go. But Im afraid your moneys gonna have to remain. Lets call it compensation for my injured feelings.
Hope,"Listen, Sonny. This is gonna be so much easier on everybody if you just give me that component."
Sonny Burch,"Darlin, the only thing youre takin from here. is my heart, but it will mend in time."
Hope,Okay.
Scott,"So, now what."
Hank,Youll see.
Sonny Burch,She said her and her daddy had something pressing.
Uzman,Mmm-hmm.
Sonny Burch,I want to know what it is because if theyre not working with us. theyre working with somebody. So find out. I want some names.
Scott,"Hold on, you gave her wings."
Sonny Burch,Get her.
Sonny Burch,"Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier. Stop firing. Stop. All right, take this. Go. Go, go, go. Go."
Scott,Wings and blasters. So I take it you didnt have that tech available for me.
Hank,"No, I did."
Hope,"It was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny."
Sonny Burch,"Oh, our business isnt finished yet, Hope. I can assure you of that. What in the hell is that."
Hope,"Dad, are you seeing this."
Hank,"Hope, get out of there."
Scott,I gotta do something.
Hank,Wait. It is still a work in progress.
Scott,You taught me that kick. Remember.
Hope,"Yeah, great form."
Scott,Those were the days. Whatever happened to us.
Hope,"Not the time, Scott. Damn it, whered it go. Ive lost it."
Scott,Im not seeing anything on the ant cams. Try looking.
Hope,Dad.
Ghost,Give me that. Now.
Hope,Are you okay.
Hank,No. He got the lab.
Hope,No.
Hank,Come on.
Hope,What was that.
Hank,I dont know. But we need to find somewhere to regroup and figure out where the lab is.
Scott,"So, where to now. How about my house. Hmm. Im supposed to be there anyway, and Woo could walk in any second."
Hank,Exactly why were not going to your house.
Scott,"What about your house. Sorry. Well, there is one place I can think of."
Hank,"No. No, no, no, no. No."
Luis,"Wow, Dr Pym. who wouldve thought that, once again, in your hour of need. that you would turn to us, you know."
Hank,Not me.
Kurt,Mmm. Help yourself.
Luis,"Hey, whats up with the fancy pastry. We gotta keep the food budget down."
Dave,"Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast."
Luis,The oatmeal packets.
Dave,Oatmeal packets.
Kurt,Its insult.
Luis,Why is it an insult.
Kurt,Because it tastes like sand.
Luis,You know why. Cause its organic.
Kurt,"Its not organic, its sand."
Dave,Its the most important meal of the day.
Luis,"You know what, you can get creative with it."
Kurt,Break teeth.
Luis,Put a little brown sugar on it. You can put some cinnamon. Put a little honey. Whatever you want.
Scott,"Guys, guys, guys. Come on, man. We got bigger fish to fry. Is that my desk."
Luis,Yeah.
Scott,What. Why do I have such a small desk.
Luis,Because you werent there when we were choosing desks.
Kurt,"You snooze, you lose."
Scott,"Well, I was under house arrest."
Luis,Yeah.
Scott,"You know what, this isnt even a desk. This is garbage. You found this outside amongst garbage."
Luis,I got it at a rummage sale.
Scott,"So, you save money on my desk."
Hope,Guys.
Scott,"Hope, please, we need to focus, all right. We gotta find that lab already. Jeez."
Luis,"Oh, you know what. I heard stories, like what happened to you. This crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff. Like a ghost."
Kurt,"Like Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga, the witch. They tell stories to children to frighten them. You know Baba Yaga."
Hope,Whoever stole it. we need to find it.
Dave,"Oh, you dont find someone like that. They find you."
Kurt,Like Baba Yaga.
Luis,"Dr Pym, youre the smartest genius I know. Didnt you put some kind of LoJack on your lab. Because if you didnt, we have a variety of affordable options."
Hank,"Of course I did, Luis. It was disabled. Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing."
Hope,They also looked like they were phasing.
Scott,Phasing.
Hank,Quantum phasing. When an object moves through different states of matter.
Scott,"Oh, yeah, thats what I was thinking."
Hope,The lab emits radiation. Can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it.
Hank,"That could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab."
Scott,Where else can we find that equipment.
Hank,"Well, there is one person. Bill Foster."
Scott,Great. Whos Bill Foster.
Hope,"Hes an old colleague of my dads, from S.H.I.E.L.D. They had a falling out years ago."
Luis,You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.
Hank,Its probably just a waste of time.
Scott,"Hey, Im risking everything by being here. Dont you think we should check."
Hope,We need to find out who took the lab.
Scott,"Guys, its not a good idea to be out in the open like this."
Hank,"Relax, no ones gonna recognize us."
Scott,"What, because of hats and sunglasses. Thats not a disguise, Hank. We look like ourselves at a baseball game."
Bill Foster,"In an isolated system. particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship. If the system is interfered with, that stability becomes chaos. Unpredictable. Dangerous. Beautiful. Isolated completely, a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter. each entangled with a distinct state of its environment. In other words, the object in question would be both in and out of phase. with multiple parallel realities. Speaking of being out of phase with reality. I am noticing an unusually high number of glazed eyes out there among you. So, why dont we call it a few minutes early. Thatll be enough for today. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go. Its incredible. Youre linked to Janet. Its quantum entanglement between the quantum states of Posner molecules in your brains."
Scott,"Yeah, thats what I was thinking. Do you guys just put the word quantum in front of everything."
Hope,"Doctor, we need to find our lab. Hope, Id love to help you. but I dont have anything like the equipment youre describing."
Hank,"I told you this is a waste of time. Come on, lets go."
Bill Foster,"Dont condescend, Hank. Youre the one whos on the run from the FBI. All because you had to grow to a size that finally fit your ego."
Scott,That wasnt me in Germany. It was this idiot. Really.
Bill Foster,"Going that big, it mustve been exhausting."
Scott,I slept for three days straight. You have no idea.
Bill Foster,"Actually, I do. Back in the day, I was Hanks partner on a project called Goliath."
Hank,Excuse me. You were my partner. The only thing more tiring than going that big is putting up with Hanks bullshit.
Scott,Right. I dont know. How big did you get.
Bill Foster,My record. 21 feet.
Scott,Not bad.
Bill Foster,You.
Scott,I dont.
Bill Foster,"No, really, Im curious."
Scott,65 feet. Yeah.
Bill Foster,Whoa. Huge.
Scott,65.
Hope,If you two are finished comparing sizes. we need to figure out a way to track down the lab.
Bill Foster,And the great Hank Pym hasnt figured that one out yet. Strange. You had all the answers back in the day. Thats why I left the project.
Hank,Left. I fired you.
Bill Foster,"Best decision I ever made. Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental. stubborn, impatient. Sooner or later, he just pushed everyone away."
Hank,Just the mediocrities.
Bill Foster,Janet was the only one who could endure him and chose to stick it out.
Hank,"Watch it, Bill."
Bill Foster,"She paid the price, though, didnt she."
Hank,You son of a bitch.
Hope,I didnt come here to listen to you two squabble. Im trying to save my mother.
Woo,"Now, which office would you say."
Scott,"Oh, its Woo. Someone must have seen me."
Hank,"Relax. If this is about you, theyd be in your house by now. What are you, 15."
Hope,Come on. We gotta go right now.
Bill Foster,Wait. You might be able to improvise that tracker. if you modify the diffraction units on one of your regulators.
Hope,That could work.
Scott,I dont know what that means.
Hope,Thank you. Thank you.
Woo,"But, Doctor, campus police says they IDd both Pym and Van Dyne."
Bill Foster,"I dont know what to tell you, Agent. I havent talked to Hank in 30 years. I can assure you Im the last person he would want to visit."
Agent,"Oh, come on, you expect us to."
Woo,"Hey, hey. Why is that."
Bill Foster,Simple. We hate each others guts.
Hank,"So Im a terrible partner. Foster, he hasnt had one good idea in his unremarkable career."
Hope,"But his idea about the diffractors could work, right."
Hank,"Fine, one decent idea. Except, I eliminated the diffractors when I upgraded the suits."
Scott,"So, if we had an old suit, we might be able to track down the lab."
Hank,"Yes, but we dont."
Scott,What if we did.
Hope,What do you mean.
Scott,I mean. lifes funny.
Hope,"Oh, my God. You didnt destroy the suit."
Hank,What.
Scott,"Well, it was your lifes work, Hank. I couldnt destroy that. Before I turned myself in, I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis."
Hank,You sent my suit through the mail.
Scott,"Hey, the postal service is very reliable. You know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS."
Hank,Where is it.
Scott,"Its in a very safe place, all right. Dont worry."
Luis,"What, the trophy. No, its not here."
Scott,What do you mean its not there. Where could it be.
Luis,"I looked everywhere. Its not here. Hey, get away from the plant."
Scott,But I put it back after Cassie and I. Show-and-tell.
Luis,"Scotty. No, stop."
Scott,"Well, the good news is I know where it is. Whenever you go back to school. isnt everything supposed to look so much smaller. This place seems huge. What is it."
Hope,Its the new regulator.
Scott,"Hank, whats going on with this suit. How much of a work in progress is this. Uh-oh. No, no, no."
Hope,Oh.
Scott,"What are you, laughing. Please, could you just."
Hope,"Okay, okay."
Hank,What do you see. The sizing coils are malfunctioning. Just let me.
Scott,Ow.
Hope,Sorry.
Scott,Its all right.
Hope,Okay. All right. Try that.
Scott,Sorry. What. Awesome.
Hope,If only Cap could see you now.
Scott,Hilarious. What are we gonna do.
Teacher,"Hey. Wheres your hall pass. Hey, Im talking to you. Hey. Hey. Eh."
Hope,You can do it. You almost got it.
Scott,"Oh, peanut."
Hope,"Okay, lets go."
Hank,"Hiya, champ, how was school today."
Scott,"All right, get your jokes out now. Can you fix the suit."
Hope,So cranky.
Hank,You want a juice box and some string cheese.
Scott,Do you really have that.
Hank,Lets see if Foster was right. This has gotta be the lab.
Hope,Lets go get it.
Hank,Yeah.
Scott,"This seems right. Look at us, teaming up twice in one day."
Hope,"Makes you think, huh."
Scott,About what.
Hope,Germany.
Scott,What do you mean.
Hope,"We were working together, training together. and other stuffing together."
Scott,"If I had asked you, would you have come."
Hope,I guess well never know. But I do know one thing.
Scott,What.
Hope,"If I had, youd have never been caught."
Hank,"Hey, Scott. You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter long enough to get my lab."
Scott,"Yes, sir."
Hank,"Thank you. Okay, youre transmitting."
Hope,What took you so long.
Scott,"Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant. Im thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant. You like it."
Hope,Hilarious.
Hank,Im not getting anything on the monitors. Theres some kind of electronic disturbance. Be careful.
Scott,"You know me, Hank. Im always careful. Whoa."
Hope,Its okay. Its just the suit.
Scott,How do you know.
Hope,Look.
Scott,Thats Ghost.
Hope,What is she doing.
Scott,Do you think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff.
Hope,Lets just get outta here before she wakes up.
Scott,"Hope, look. Theres the lab. Now, were sure this is our shrunken building and not somebody elses, right."
Hope,"Just take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast."
Scott,Ill get it.
Hope,"Oh, shit."
Scott,Hope. Hope. Hank. Guys.
Ghost,I dont think they can hear you. Hi. Im Ava.
Scott,"Scott. So, you dont need the suit. to go through things."
Ghost,"No. It just helps me control it. And the pain, supposedly."
Scott,"Youre not gonna reach into my chest and crush my heart, are you."
Ghost,"Youre funny. Im not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to. I need. whats in your head. Lets wake up the rest of the gang and get this over with, shall we. Get up. Come on."
Hope,Dad. Dont ever touch him again.
Ghost,"Now, now, Hope. I think Im being rather gentle with your father, all things considered."
Hank,What the hell are you talking about.
Bill Foster,Another casualty of Hank Pyms ego.
Hank,Bill. What have you done.
Ghost,"Its what youve done, Dr Pym."
Scott,"Youre with her. Oh, man. I thought you were cool."
Hope,What the hell is going on here.
Ghost,"I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father. Why would he. Elihas Starr. They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D. Quantum research. Until my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym. You had him fired. Oh, and discredited for good measure. My father tried to continue his research on his own. Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks."
Father of Ghost,"No, no, no."
Ghost,Too many. Until something went wrong. He told us to run.
Mother of Ghost,"Elihas, whats happening."
Father of Ghost,Just go. Go.
Ghost,Daddy. Daddy. I could tell he was scared. Daddy.
Mother of Ghost,"Ava, no."
Ghost,"I didnt want him to be alone. No. No. When I woke up, my parents were dead. I wasnt so lucky. They call it molecular disequilibrium. A rather dull name, I think. Doesnt quite do justice to what it means. Every cell in my body is torn apart. and stitched back together. Over and over. Every day."
Bill Foster,"I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call about a quantum anomaly in Argentina. Hello, Ava. My names Bill. I was a friend of your fathers. I brought you something. Its all right. Try again. Thats it."
Ghost,"Dr Foster did his best to keep me safe. But others at S.H.I.E.L.D. saw an opportunity in my affliction. They built me a containment suit, so I could control my phasing. And trained me to be a stealth operative. They weaponized me. I stole for them. Spied for them. k*lled for them. And in exchange for my soul. they were going to cure me. They lied."
Bill Foster,"When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in. I built the chamber to slow her decay, but her condition was progressive. I didnt know how to cure it. She wanted to k*ll you, Hank, but I told her no. and that she should watch you instead. And sure enough, she discovered that you were building the tunnel. Then, she told me about Lang. And the message from Janet inside his head, thats when I. Christs sake."
Scott,"Thats me. Im sorry. Look, can you tell me whos texting me."
Bill Foster,"Cassie, 911."
Scott,Thats my daughter. I need to text her back.
Bill Foster,"No, thats not happening."
Scott,"What, its 911. That means its an emergency."
Bill Foster,"Youre not making demands here, Lang. Youre not appreciating the gravity of the."
Scott,"Okay, look, shes trying to video chat me now. Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please. Cassie, are you okay. Whats the emergency."
Cassandra,I cant find my soccer shoes.
Scott,What.
Cassandra,I have a game tomorrow.
Maggie,"Hey, Scott, I know that theyre there. Can you just walk the phone around the house."
Scott,"No, I cant do that right now."
Maggie,Why not.
Scott,Because Im sick.
Maggie,"Hey, can you just maybe look around later then and call me back. Please. Thank you."
Cassandra,"Bye, Daddy."
Scott,"Bye, peanut. Feel better."
Paxton,"Feel better, buddy."
Scott,Im sorry. It said emergency.
Hank,"Ava, I want to help you."
Bill Foster,She doesnt need your help. I know how to save her.
Hank,"Oh, really. How."
Ghost,Janet.
Bill Foster,"For the last 30 years, shes been down there absorbing quantum energy. We can extract that energy. We can use it to repair Avas molecular structure."
Hank,Extract it.
Bill Foster,Yes.
Hank,Are you insane. That would rip Janet apart.
Bill Foster,"You dont know that. Im gonna fire up your tunnel. When Janets location pops into Langs head, hes gonna give it to me. or Im gonna turn him over to the FBI."
Scott,What.
Bill Foster,You are gonna stay here. just in case I need your help.
Hank,Like hell I would help you.
Ghost,Youll do whatever I say.
Hank,Youre gonna k*ll Janet.
Ghost,"Id be more worried about yourself, Hank."
Hank,"g*dd*mn it, Bill."
Hope,Dad.
Bill Foster,"Calm down, Hank."
Hank,So help me God. The pills.
Hope,"Its his heart. He needs his pills. Please, Dr Foster. Theyre in the tin. Please. He could die. Come on."
Scott,Help him.
Hope,"Dad, just hang on, all right. Just keep breathing. Stay calm."
Scott,"Help him, man. Come on."
Hope,The Altoid tin.
Ghost,Wait.
Scott,"Thanks, guys. Hank."
Hank,"Bill is filling that girls head with lies. Elihas Starr was a traitor. He stole my plans. Now, bring it down. All right, lock it in. No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side. Tighten that one down, then bring it down one notch. Good job."
Hope,Itll work.
Hank,"Foster, he could have fried the entire system."
Hope,"Look, well adjust the relays while you go reprogram the settings, all right. Its going to be fine."
Scott,"So, this is it."
Hope,Yeah. Youd think with all this time to prepare Id be more ready.
Scott,"Oh, going subatomic isnt something you can prepare for. It kind of melts your mind."
Hope,I mean seeing my mom again.
Scott,Oh.
Hope,What if shes a completely different person.
Scott,"Yeah, like, uh, George Washington."
Hope,"Im serious, Scott."
Scott,Or George Jefferson.
Hope,What if shes forgotten about me.
Scott,When I was in prison. the only thing that got me through was Cassie. I could have been locked up for 100 years. I never would have forgotten her. I know your mom is counting the minutes until she can see you again.
Hope,Thank you.
Scott,Hey.
Luis,We got a big problem. You forgot the motion sensor lights on the back of the building.
Scott,"Oh, no."
Luis,"And theyre on the proposal, and Karapetyan asked for them specifically."
Scott,"Uh, yeah, look, its been a little crazy. Look, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it."
Luis,"No. No, no, no, no. The meeting is first thing in the morning. You gotta come right now and fix it."
Scott,"I cant. I wish I could, but I cant leave."
Luis,"You know what, Im coming to you. Ill just bring the plans. Theyre on the laptop. And you can fix them there. Just tell me where you are, okay."
Scott,Its complicated.
Luis,What do you mean its complicated.
Dave,"As you can see, sir, this system is state of the art."
Kurt,"Security of tomorrow, today."
Luis,"Oh, thats so good. And I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin. Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scottys, so we can fix the plans. But dont worry, Ill be back in plenty of time."
Dave,As you can see.
Luis,"Oh, oh, oh. Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning."
Dave,"Down to the undercarriage, baby."
Luis,You sprung for the undercarriage wash.
Dave,"Well, you said get the works."
Luis,"Thats a scam, bro. We live in California, not Minnesota."
Sonny Burch,"Hes right. The undercarriage wash, thats for cleaning off road salt. laid down in our more snow-laden sister states."
Luis,"Who are you, and why do you know so much about car wash protocol."
Sonny Burch,"Well, my name is Sonny Burch. And I do my research, Luis. To wit, I have learned from a friend of mine. at the FBI that you are a known associate of Scott Lang. a known associate of Hank Pym, who Ive also learned. has a portable shrinking laboratory. filled with all kinds of juicy tech. And youre gonna tell me where it is."
Luis,"Well, I hate to break it to you, but I dont know what youre talking about."
Sonny Burch,"Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis. And I have promised results to some dangerous people. So, Im gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman. Now. Uzman is a master at extracting information from the unwilling. through psychoactive means."
Luis,"Oh, is that truth serum."
Uzman,Theres no such thing as truth serum. Thats just nonsense from TV.
Dave,"Well, what is it then."
Sonny Burch,Its a little concoction that hes been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S. It makes you suggestible and highly responsive.
Luis,"Well, dude, thats truth serum."
Uzman,"No, its not."
Kurt,"No offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me."
Luis,Right.
Gang Member,Its not a truth serum.
Luis,"Okay. Hey, I believe you."
Gang Member,Its not a truth serum.
Kurt,"I mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks."
Dave,The truth serum.
Luis,"Well, I have a lot of allergies. so you might wanna think about that."
Bill Foster,Weve got to get that lab back.
Ghost,What.
Bill Foster,The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore.
Ghost,How long have I got.
Bill Foster,"A couple of weeks, maybe."
Ghost,"Well, then well make them bring the lab back."
Bill Foster,How.
Ghost,"Lang. He has a daughter, right."
Bill Foster,You cant mean that. Ava. I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there. but I wont be a part of anything like that.
Ghost,"Youre not the one whos about to fade away into nothing, Bill. I am. You said you could fix me. You promised."
Bill Foster,I know. I will. But not like that. You lay one finger on that little girl. I wont help you. And were done.
Ghost,Fine. There are other options.
Luis,You know what. Youre right. This isnt truth serum. Because I dont feel anything. That was a lie. I do feel something. This is truth serum.
Uzman,Theres no such thing.
Sonny Burch,"Okay. Okay, okay. Now, Im gonna make this real easy for you, Luis."
Luis,Okay.
Sonny Burch,Where is Scott Lang.
Luis,"Well, see, thats complicated. Because when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And Im not talkin about cell block D. His wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like. Damn, homie. She dumped you when youre on lockup. And he was, like, Yeah, I know. I thought I was gonna be with her forever. but now Im all alone. And I was, like, Damn, homie. You know what. You gotta chin up, because youll find a new partner. But you know what. Im Luis. And he says, You know what. Im Scotty, and were gonna be best friends."
Sonny Burch,"Okay, hold on, hold on. I like a good story as much as the next person. but what in the hell does this have to do with where Scott Lang is."
Luis,Im getting there. Im getting there.
Dave,"You put a dime in him, you gotta let the whole song play out."
Kurt,He like human jukebox.
Luis,"Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant. Yeah, only played Morrissey. And if anybody ever complained, shed be like. You know, Chicanos, we call him Moz. Then, ¡adios. What can I say. We relate to his melancholy ballads, you know."
Sonny Burch,Lang.
Luis,"Right, right, right. So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail, and he starts working for Hank. Thats when he met Hope. And Hopes all, like. I want nothing to do with you. Look at my hairdo, Im all business. And then Scottys, like, You know what, girl. My heart is all broken. And Ill probably never find love again, but damn if I want to kiss you. But then you fast forward and theyre all into each other, right. And then Scottys, like, You know what. I cant tell you this. but Im gonna go trash an airport with Captain America. And then she said, I cant believe you split like that. Smell you later, dummy. So, Scotty goes on house arrest. And he wont admit it, but his heart is all, like. Damn. I thought Hope coulda been my new true partner, but I blew it. But fate brought em back together. And then Hopes heart is all. Im worried that I cant trust him. and hes gonna screw up again, and ruin everything. And then my heart is all, like. That fancy raspberry filling represents the companys red and were days away from going out of business. Oh."
Kurt,Out of business.
Dave,Days away.
Luis,"Damn truth serum. I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God. I was trying to be a good boss, but were broke. And the Karapetyans our last hope. And if we dont show up, were done."
Kurt,Thats terrible bossing.
Dave,"Damn, bro."
Luis,Thats on me. Thats on me.
Sonny Burch,Hey. Enough. Im gonna ask you one more time. Where is Scott Lang.
Luis,"Ive been trying to tell you, hes in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking."
Sonny Burch,"Emotionally speaking. Well, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking."
Luis,Oh. The woods.
Ghost,The woods.
Kurt,Baba Yaga.
Ghost,"What do you mean, the woods."
Luis,"The Muir Woods, the second fire road off the Panoramic Highway."
Ghost,For Gods sake.
Kurt,"♪ Baba Yaga, come at night ♪ Little children, sleepy tight"
Sonny Burch,♪ Damn it. If that freak gets Pyms tech. Im never gonna see it.
Uzman,"So, what do we do now."
Sonny Burch,"Its easier to steal it from the Feds than from the boogeyman. Hey, its me. Howd you like to get a promotion. I got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang. But you gonna have to take em down now, because they aint gonna be there for long. And when you do, you gonna get me that lab."
Cop 1,Understood.
Sonny Burch,"Good news, gentlemen. Feds are gonna do the hard work for us. What are you lookin at. Change my tires."
Uzman,Right.
Cop 1,Sir.
Woo,Can you knock.
Cop 1,"Sorry, sir. Uh, but I just got a lead."
Woo,"Ooh, I love leads."
Hope,Systems in the green.
Hank,Priming the coils.
Hope,Full charge. As soon as the tunnels open. let us know if you get anything that could be a part of her message.
Scott,"Yeah, yeah. I will."
Hank,"Okay, then. Here it goes."
Hope,We did it.
Hank,You got anything.
Scott,Nothin.
Hank,"Well, just give it a minute, because it could."
Hope,"No. No, no, no, no. Whats happening. Its shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off."
Hank,"Weve gone over them a million times, I know theyre right."
Hope,Then what else could it be.
Hank,I dont know.
Hope,"Scott, what are you doing."
Hank,"Scott, get away from that."
Hope,"Scott, you cant."
Janet,"Im sorry, I dont know how much time I have. I need to fix the algorithm. Trust me, after 30 years down here. Ive thought about it a lot."
Hank,Janet.
Janet,"Hi, honey. Jellybean."
Hope,Mom.
Janet,Its not the reunion Id imagined. Its all so rushed. You two have done such great work. You just need a little. nudge.
Hank,"Janet, how is this possible."
Hope,It wasnt a message you put in Scotts head. It was an antenna.
Janet,Clever girl. Im so proud of you.
Hank,"Honey, tell us where you are. Tell us how to find you."
Janet,"No, the probability fields are too complex. Thats why I needed to talk to you. You have to follow my voice."
Hank,Of course.
Hope,Like tracing a call back to its source.
Hank,Im tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies. between point two and point nine.
Janet,Id narrow it to four and six.
Hank,Thats too tight. We could miss you.
Janet,Look at us squabbling again.
Hank,"Fine. All right, between three and seven."
Janet,"Our first fight in decades, and its over just like that. Bullseye."
Hope,Source lock.
Hank,Its you.
Hope,We got it.
Janet,"You have to meet me at these exact coordinates. In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void. Its very dangerous, especially on the human mind, so be careful. Time and space work very differently down here. You have two hours. After that, the probability fields will shift. and itll be another century before they align like this again."
Hope,Well find you.
Janet,"I know you will, Jellybean."
Scott,"Nope. Nothing. I got nothing. No sign of Janet. Perfect. How did we get up here. All right, first youre gonna see all kinds of lights. and its gonna get really trippy. but then its gonna turn black and silent. Really silent."
Hope,"Scott, Ill be fine."
Scott,Im just saying because Ive been down there.
Hope,"Yeah, so youve mentioned."
Scott,"Um, sorry. I have to take this. Hey, man, you coming."
Luis,"No, Im not, but you know what. Ghost is. And you know what. The Feds, they know where you are."
Scott,What.
Luis,"Im sorry, Im sorry. Uh, they gave me some truth serum. And then all of a sudden I started talkin all honestly. Like, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher. I hate it, I hate it."
Scott,Uh.
Luis,But you need to go home. because the Feds are probably going there now. And by the way. who puts the plates on the top rack. They dont go there.
Scott,I feel like such a jerk. Youre gonna be really mad. We gotta go now.
Hope,What.
Scott,Ghost knows where we are. So does the FBI.
Hope,How.
Scott,I told Luis where we are.
Hope,You what.
Scott,I told him to come here so I could help him with the Karapetyan proposal.
Hope,"Oh, my God."
Scott,"Look, we need to land that account. Otherwise, we lose the business. Do you know hard it is for ex-cons to find work these days."
Hank,"Jesus, Scott."
Hope,90 seconds to close the aperture.
Hank,You have to depolarize the coils first.
Hope,I know.
Scott,"Im really sorry. but the, um, FBI is coming to my place so. I have to go. Can I borrow the suit."
Machine voice,Gyroscopic stabilizers. Powering on.
Scott,Im just gonna borrow the suit. Ill come back. Just tell me where youll be.
Hope,Dont bother.
Scott,What.
Hope,"Well come and get the suit from you, as soon as weve found my mom."
Scott,Hope.
Hope,"Scott, just go."
Maggie,Scott.
Cassandra,Daddy.
Paxton,"Its us, buddy."
Maggie,Were here for Cassies shoes.
Paxton,He must be resting.
Maggie,"Honey, why dont you go upstairs and look under your bed."
Cassandra,"Daddy, you upstairs. Daddy."
Paxton,What the.
Maggie,He really lives like a pig these days.
Cassandra,Daddy.
Woo,Spread out. Again.
Maggie,You people have no shame.
Agent 2,The monitor says that hes in the bathroom.
Woo,"Yeah, Im not buying it."
Maggie,"Cassie, let the man get by."
Cassandra,But Daddys super sick.
Woo,Ill see about that.
Cassandra,He says he doesnt want anyone else to get sick.
Woo,"Ill take my chances, sweetie."
Cassandra,"He barfed. Like, a lot."
Woo,"Young lady, Im a federal agent. Ive seen worse things than vomit. Like, a lot a lot."
Cassandra,Yes.
Woo,"Forget it, move aside."
Cassandra,No.
Scott,Woo. What are you doing here.
Woo,Scott.
Scott,"Im sorry, Im just really sick."
Cassandra,I told you.
Scott,Excuse me. Sometimes you gotta just get it out. You know. Sorry.
Hank,Ill start the van. You get the lab.
Cop 2,Freeze. Youre surrounded.
Cop 1,Hank Pym. Hope Van Dyne. youre under arrest.
Maggie,This is harassment.
Paxton,"Actually, its not."
Maggie,What does the FBI even stand for. Forever Bothering Individuals.
Woo,His monitor check out.
Scott,Of course it does.
Woo,Damn it. Looks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey.
Agent 2,We got em sir. Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.
Woo,"Seriously. Yes. Oh, Im sorry, Scott. Theyre your friends. Thats insensitive. I just really needed a win, you know. Anyway, Ill be back later for the official end of your sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal. You should feel great about yourself."
Cop 3,What is it.
Cop 4,We have a man down. And Pyms lab is gone.
Scott,Hey. Thanks for covering for me.
Cassandra,Sure. So. how long have you been Ant-Man again.
Scott,Not long. It just sort of happened. Im sorry for lying to you. and Im sorry for risking everything.
Cassandra,"Daddy, its okay."
Scott,Its not. I do some dumb things. and the people that I love the most pay the price. Mainly you.
Cassandra,Trying to help people isnt dumb.
Scott,I screw it up just about every time.
Cassandra,"So, maybe you just need someone watching your back. like a partner."
Scott,"Well, shes made it clear thats about the last thing she wants."
Cassandra,Who.
Scott,"Hope. Wait, who did you think."
Cassandra,Me.
Scott,You.
Cassandra,Dont laugh. Id be a great partner.
Scott,"Aw, peanut. Aw. You would be awesome. And if I let you. I would be a terrible dad."
Cassandra,Fine. Then have Hope be your partner. Shes smart.
Scott,She reminds me of you.
Cassandra,You gonna go help her. I think you should help her.
Scott,I wish I could. but I dont know how I could help her without hurting you.
Cassandra,You can do it. You can do anything. You are the worlds greatest grandma.
Agent 3,Agent Woo will see you in an hour.
Hank,An hour. We dont have an hour.
Agent 3,"Oh, you got somewhere else to be."
Hank,"Oh, now, thats my girl. All right, whats our plan."
Hope,To shrink that wall.
Hank,It looks load-bearing. The ceiling could collapse.
Hope,Then we run like hell.
Hank,"Now, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor."
Hope,Roughly five times that in the building at large.
Hank,Theyre all heavily armed.
Hope,Not great odds.
Hank,You got any better ideas.
Hope,Nope. And Im not giving up on Mom.
Hank,Shed be so proud of you.
Hope,Okay. One. two. Scott.
Scott,Whatre you two just standing around for. We gotta go find that lab.
Hank,What about me. Perfect.
Scott,Hurry up and get dressed. We dont have much time.
Hope,"Okay, now what."
Hank,Youre asking me.
Scott,Get in. Hi.
Hope,Hi.
Hank,"Uh, excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon. or are you two gonna keep staring at each other. until they start sh**ting at us."
Scott,Yeah.
Uzman,"Hey, Burch."
Sonny Burch,Yeah.
Uzman,"Yeah, theyre out."
Sonny Burch,Im on my way.
Agent 2,"Her suit is missing, and so is the van."
Woo,"How could this happen. I mean, what the dickens."
Hank,Thank you.
Scott,"Youre welcome. So, uh, how do we find the lab."
Hank,After we lost it the first time. I put on a new tracker. of sorts.
Scott,Thatll work.
Ghost,Is it ready or not.
Bill Foster,"We can begin the extraction process. Listen, Ava. This whole thing could be very dangerous. Maybe we should."
Ghost,"Maybe we should what. Wait. Ive got days until Im dead. Were doing this, Bill. Now."
Hank,Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet.
Hope,"We dont have much time before Moms location shifts, and we lose her."
Scott,"Yeah, and we have a lot to do before then. You know, my pep-pep always said, If you want to do something right, you make a list. So, we should do that. One, we have to break into that lab. Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost. Three, were gonna have to fight Ghost. That seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right. Lets call it 2-A. Fight Ghost. 2-A. Oh, also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown for you to come back. Otherwise, were screwed."
Hank,Scott.
Scott,You want me to start again. Ill start again.
Hank,"Im going to dive. The only chance we got is if the two of you are out here. together, protecting the tunnel. Let me do this, Hope. Please. Let me get her."
Scott,I think hes right.
Luis,"Whassup. You dont remember, uh, that beloved commercial. Whassup."
Scott,I had him follow us. I thought we could use some help. All right. Im in position. The ants are headed in.
Hope,Copy that.
Luis,"Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty. Do you want Pez."
Hope,No.
Luis,"Cassie gave me this for my birthday. By the way, I love that suit."
Hope,"Thanks, man."
Luis,"I wish I had a suit. I would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know. Or maybe even just a suit, with no powers."
Ghost,What is it.
Bill Foster,Dont know. Its them.
Ghost,They cant be far.
Bill Foster,"All right, Hank. Hank."
Hope,"Dad, whats your status."
Hank,Fosters taken care of. Suiting up now.
Bill Foster,I just wanted to save Ava. Shes facing death or something far more terrible. Shes afraid.
Hank,"Ill help you find a cure when I get back. I promise. Together, well figure something out."
Bill Foster,"Good luck, Hank."
Hank,"Thanks, Bill. Now, Im gonna need you to step back."
Machine voice,"Time remaining, 15 minutes."
Hope,"Hanks in, Scott. Any sign of her."
Scott,"No, nothing yet. Ava."
Ghost,"Call off the ants, Scott."
Scott,"Oh, boy. Can I get a status report. Cause I got some serious Ghost problems here."
Hank,Ready to dive. In case I dont make it.
Hope,"Dont. Dont say that. I cant lose you, too."
Hank,"I love you, Hope."
Scott,"Guys, everythings bad over here."
Hope,Now.
Scott,Misdirection. One of the first things they teach you at Online Close-up Magic University.
Ghost,No.
Luis,"Plan worked. We got it, Scotty."
Hope,Meet us at the rendezvous point.
Scott,"Okay, on my way."
Hope,"Oh, no. Really. This guy again."
Scott,Who.
Sonny Burch,I told you our business wasnt over.
Hope,Change of plans. Hang on.
Sonny Burch,"I want that lab, boys, whatever it takes. Hold on."
Luis,That undercarriage is filthy.
Hope,"Oh, they got bigger problems."
Scott,"Hope, whatre you doing. Youre heading away from the rendezvous point."
Hope,"Dont worry, Im taking these guys on the scenic route."
Scott,"Wait, whatre you."
Luis,"Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Were gonna die. Were gonna die."
Machine voice,Signal lost.
Hank,What the hell are they doing up there.
Machine voice,Recalibrating. Recalibrating.
Hank,"You never said it was so beautiful, Scott."
Machine voice,Recalibrating.
Hank,"Okay, any time now."
Machine voice,Recalibrating. Recalibrating.
Hank,Come on.
Machine voice,Signal restored.
Sonny Burch,"Bikes, its all you."
Hope,Take the wheel.
Scott,What. Wait. Whoa.
Stan Lee,"Well, the 60s were fun, but now Im paying for it."
Hope,Be careful up there.
Scott,"Hey, give me a break. I havent driven in two years."
Luis,"Oh, you got pezed."
Scott,"Up here. Oh, thats not good. Hope. No. No."
Sonny Burch,"There it is, right there. Get the lab. Get the lab."
Hope,Ive got her. Westbound on Fremont.
Scott,Hope. Wait.
Luis,"Hey, what about me."
Scott,"We got you now, Ava. Whoa. Oh. Not again. Piece of junk."
Sonny Burch,"Ah. Yes. Go, go, go, go, go."
Hope,Burch got the lab. Im going after him.
Scott,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Work in progress, my ass."
Hope,"Scott, where are you. Ive got Burch in my sights. Hurry."
Scott,"Im coming, Im coming, Im coming."
Hope,Were running out of time.
Machine voice,"Warning, approaching quantum void."
Hank,"Im coming to you, honey."
Luis,Guys. Dont you need the remote to the lab. I just found it.
Hope,We cant grow the lab without it. Get it to us fast.
Luis,"Yeah, but the van is busted."
Scott,Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.
Luis,"What. I love you, Dr Pym."
Sonny Burch,The remote. Were missing the remote. You gotta check the van.
Gang Member 4,Huh.
Luis,"Awesome. Hey, Im going down Pacific. Burchs boys are all over me."
Hope,Im on my way.
Scott,Right. Ill get the lab.
Hope,Hi.
Luis,"Oh, thats badass. Nice."
Scott,"Doink. Come here, you little weasel. No, you dont. I guess maybe you do. Come on. Anyone see a Southern gentleman carrying a building. Howd he even have time to buy a ticket. Would you just one time, please work. Yes. All right, I need help. Yes. Oh. Sorry. Ah. Somebody. Hey. Come on, man. Not cool. Murderers. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Im gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas. Youre a badass. Yes. No, no, no. Ant-onio."
Announcer,"Our friends, the humpbacks, dip in here to the San Francisco Bay. for a little leisure and a little breeding."
Sonny Burch,"Listen, Uzman."
Announcer,"And perhaps theyre down below as we speak, doing the nasty."
Sonny Burch,Just meet me at the waterfront. In three hours.
Announcer,"Oh, folks. Weve barely left the dock. but it looks like we got some company. Look. Right there. Do you see it, folks. There it is. Theres a breach. What the."
Scott,"Hi. Sorry. Hi. Its okay. Its okay. Sorry, I know Im not a whale. This will just take a second. Hey. That doesnt belong to you. No, no. No, no. Youre embarrassing yourself now Come on. Let go. Thank you. Ill take this now."
Scott,It melts your mind.
Hope,A message in your head.
Scott,I had a dream.
Hope,Daddy. Wheres Mommy. Its where I hid every time that we played.
Janet,"I love you, Hank."
Hope,Daddy. Daddy. Dad. Whats going on. Why havent you found Mom.
Scott,"You look lost, Hank. Are you all right."
Bill Foster,"Still think you have all the answers, Hank."
Janet,Its me.
Hank,Im so sorry. it took so long.
Janet,No. No. Youre here now. Lets go home.
Hank,I thought I was gone. But that energy from your hands. how did you do that.
Janet,"Im not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry. This place. it changes you. Adaptation is part of it, but some of it is. evolution."
Machine voice,Lab coordinates not found. Do not ascend.
Hank,I should probably tell you what were dealing with up there.
Scott,I got the lab. I got the lab. Move. Move. Move. Get out of the way.
Woo,Lets go.
News Reporter 1,No one here appears to be sure what this is. Its gotta be 80-85 feet tall.
Scott,Get out of the way. I got the lab. The air feels chunky.
Hope,"Oh, no. Hes too big."
Luis,Scotty.
Hope,Scott.
Scott,Im gonna go to sleep. Im just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes. I just need five minutes. Five minutes.
Luis,You get the lab somewhere safe. Scotts air wont last.
Luis,"Okay. Move. Move. Move. No, wait."
Machine voice,Lab at full scale.
Hank,They did it.
Machine voice,Ready to ascend.
Janet,Lets go see our daughter.
Hope,"Scott. Scott. Scott, come on, wake up. Come on. Come on, where are you, Scott. Gotcha. Scott."
Scott,Hey. Hey.
Luis,"Hey, Scotty. Hope, come in. Did you get crushed by the building."
Sonny Burch,"Wheres the remote, Luis."
Luis,Its probably in there. I dont have it. I dont have it.
Sonny Burch,"I guess this is where we say. Adios, amigo."
Luis,"No, no, no, no. Thanks, guys."
Bill Foster,"Ava. Ava. Ava. Almost ready for extraction. Please, stop. People are getting hurt."
Ghost,Everything hurts. Dont talk to me about pain.
Bill Foster,What if Hank is right. What if this process kills Janet.
Ghost,"What, youre worried about her."
