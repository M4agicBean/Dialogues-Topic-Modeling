Asgardian PA,"This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard. Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft."
Ebony Maw,"Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile. for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos."
Thanos,"I know what its like to lose. To feel so desperately that youre right. yet to fail, nonetheless. Its frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, its here. Or should I say. I AM."
Thor,You talk too much.
Thanos,"The Tesseract, or your brothers head. I assume you have a preference."
Loki,"Oh, I do. Kill away."
Loki,"ALL RIGHT, STOP."
Thor,We dont have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.
Thor,You really are the worst brother.
Loki,"I assure you, brother. the sun will shine on us again."
Thanos,"Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian."
Loki,"Well, for one thing, Im not Asgardian. And for another. we have a Hulk."
Ebony Maw,Let him have his fun.
Heimdall,Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last. time.
Thanos,That was a mistake.
Thor,NO. Youre going to die for that.
Ebony Maw,Shh.
Ebony Maw,"My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp."
Thanos,"There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan."
Proxima Midnight,"Father, we will not fail you."
Cull Obsidian,"Were going to New York City and We will tear The Avengers Apart and Smash. Once and for all, my lord."
Loki,"If I might interject… if youre going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena."
Thanos,If you consider failure experience.
Loki,"I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I. Loki. Prince of Asgard. Odinson. the rightful King of Jotunheim. God of Mischief. do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity."
Thanos,Undying. You should choose your words more carefully.
Loki,You will. never be. a god.
Thor,NO.
Thanos,No resurrections this time.
Thor,No… Loki….
Stephen Strange,Seriously. You dont have any money.
Wong,Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.
Stephen Strange,Ill tell the guys at the deli. Maybe theyll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.
Wong,"Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200."
Stephen Strange,Dollars.
Wong,Rupees.
Stephen Strange,Which is.
Wong,"Uh, buck and a half."
Stephen Strange,What do you want.
Wong,I wouldnt say no to a tuna melt.
Bruce Banner,Thanos is coming. Hes coming.
Stephen Strange,Who.
Tony Stark,"Slow down, slow down. Im totally not kidding."
Pepper Potts,Youre totally rambling.
Tony Stark,"No, Im not."
Pepper Potts,Lost me.
Tony Stark,"Look, you know how youre having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee."
Pepper Potts,Yeah.
Tony Stark,"Okay, and then youre like, Oh my god, theres no bathroom, what am I gonna do., Oh. Someones watching, m gonna go in my pants."
Pepper Potts,"Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee."
Tony Stark,Yes.
Pepper Potts,Yeah. Everybody has that.
Tony Stark,"Right. Thats the point Im trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name."
Pepper Potts,Right.
Tony Stark,Morgan. Morgan.
Pepper Potts,"So you woke up, and thought that we were."
Tony Stark,Expecting.
Pepper Potts,Yeah.
Tony Stark,Yes.
Pepper Potts,No.
Tony Stark,I had a dream about it. It was so real.
Pepper Potts,"If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldnt have done that."
Tony Stark,"Im glad you brought this up, cause its nothing. Its just a housing unit for nano particles."
Pepper Potts,"Its not helping your case, OK."
Tony Stark,"No, no, its an attachment, its not a-"
Pepper Potts,You dont need that.
Tony Stark,"I know. I had the surgery. Im just trying to protect us. The future uses, and thats it. Just in case theres a monster in the closet, instead of, you know."
Pepper Potts,Shirts.
Tony Stark,You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
Pepper Potts,You should have shirts in your closet.
Tony Stark,Yeah. You know what there should be. No more surprises. Were gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right. And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
Pepper Potts,Yes.
Tony Stark,I will.
Stephen Strange,"Tony Stark, Im Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way."
Tony Stark,"Im sorry, you giving out tickets or something."
Stephen Strange,"We need your help. Look, its not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake."
Tony Stark,And whos we.
Bruce Banner,"Hey, Tony."
Tony Stark,Bruce.
Bruce Banner,Pepper.
Pepper Potts,Hi.
Tony Stark,You okay.
Wong,"From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom. The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence."
Stephen Strange,Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.
Tony Stark,Tell me his name again.
Bruce Banner,"Thanos. Hes a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. Thats him."
Tony Stark,This is it. Whats our timeline.
Bruce Banner,"No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony."
Stephen Strange,He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.
Tony Stark,Did you seriously just say hitherto undreamt of.
Stephen Strange,Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos.
Tony Stark,Is that what this is. .
Tony Stark,"Im going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why dont we just stick this one down the garbage disposal."
Stephen Strange,No can do.
Wong,We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.
Tony Stark,"And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerrys named a flavor after me, so."
Stephen Strange,Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
Tony Stark,Its not bad.
Stephen Strange,A bit chalky.
Wong,A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge is our favorite.
Bruce Banner,Thats a thing.
Tony Stark,Whatever. Point is: things change.
Stephen Strange,Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
Tony Stark,"And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us."
Stephen Strange,"Well, if we dont do our jobs."
Tony Stark,"What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals."
Stephen Strange,"Protecting your reality, douchebag."
Bruce Banner,"Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now. The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now."
Tony Stark,"Yeah, thats the. thing."
Bruce Banner,What do you mean.
Tony Stark,"Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. Hes offline."
Bruce Banner,"What. Tony, you lost another super bot."
Tony Stark,I didnt lose him. Hes more than that. Hes evolving.
Stephen Strange,"Who could find Vision, then."
Tony Stark,Shit. Probably Steve Rogers.
Stephen Strange,"Oh, great."
Tony Stark,Maybe. But.
Bruce Banner,Call him.
Tony Stark,"Its not that easy. God, we havent caught up in a spell, have we."
Bruce Banner,No.
Tony Stark,The Avengers broke up. Were toast.
Bruce Banner,Broke up. Like a band. Like The Beatles.
Tony Stark,Cap and I fell out hard. Were not on speaking terms.
Bruce Banner,"Tony, listen to me. Thors gone. Thanos is coming. It doesnt matter who youre talking to or not."
Tony Stark,"Say, Doc, you wouldnt happen to be moving your hair, would you."
Stephen Strange,"Not at the moment, no."
Tony Stark,You okay.
Tony Stark,"Help him. Wong, Doc."
Bruce Banner,Go. Got it.
Tony Stark,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at."
F.R.I.D.A.Y.,"Not sure, Im working on it."
Tony Stark,"Hey. You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc."
Stephen Strange,Might wanna use it.
Peter Parker,"Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction."
Ned Leeds,Holy shit. Were all gonna die. Theres a spaceship.
"School Bus Driver, Stan Lee",Whats the matter with you kids. Youve never seen a spaceship before.
Tony Stark,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders."
F.R.I.D.A.Y.,Will do.
Ebony Maw,"Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to."
Tony Stark,"Im sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here."
Ebony Maw,Stonekeeper. Does this chattering animal speak for you.
Stephen Strange,Certainly not. I speak for myself. But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet.
Tony Stark,"It means get lost, Squidward."
Ebony Maw,He exhausts me.
Cull Obsidian,
Ebony Maw,Bring me the Stone.
Cull Obsidian,
Tony Stark,"Banner, you want a piece."
Bruce Banner,"No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want."
Tony Stark,Thats right.
Tony Stark,"Been a while. Good to have you, buddy."
Bruce Banner,"I just. I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man."
Tony Stark,Wheres your guy.
Bruce Banner,I dont know. Weve sort been havin a thing.
Tony Stark,Theres no time for a thing.
Bruce Banner,I know.
Tony Stark,Thats the thing right there. Lets go.
Tony Stark,"Dude, youre embarrassing me in front of the wizards."
Bruce Banner,"Tony, Im sorry. Either I cant or he wont--"
Tony Stark,"Its okay. Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you."
Wong,I have him.
Bruce Banner,Damn it.
Bruce Banner,Whered that come from.
Tony Stark,Its nano-tech. You like it. A little someth--
Stephen Strange,"Dr Banner, if the rest of your green friend wont be joining us."
Tony Stark,"Gotta get that stone outta here, now."
Stephen Strange,It stays with me.
Tony Stark,Exactly. Bye.
Bruce Banner,"Tony, you okay. How we doing. Good. Bad."
Tony Stark,"Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out."
Bruce Banner,Im trying. He wont come out.
Tony Stark,Hammer.
Bruce Banner,"Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me. Come out. Come out. Come out."
Hulk,Nooooooo.
Bruce Banner,"What do you mean, no."
Peter Parker,"Hey, man. Whats up, Mr Stark."
Tony Stark,"Kid, whered you come from."
Peter Parker,Field trip to MoMA.
Peter Parker,"What is this guys problem, Mr Stark."
Tony Stark,Hes from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
Ebony Maw,Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
Stephen Strange,Its a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
Ebony Maw,Then Ill take it off your corpse.
Stephen Strange,Youll find. removing a dead mans spell. troublesome.
Ebony Maw,Youll only wish you were dead. NO.
Tony Stark,"Kid, thats the wizard. Get on it."
Peter Parker,On it.
Peter Parker,Not cool.
Peter Parker,"Uhhh, Mr Stark. Im being beamed up."
Tony Stark,"Hang on, kid."
Tony Stark,"Wong, youre invited to my wedding. Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y."
Tony Stark,"Unlock 17-A. Pete, you gotta let go. Im gonna catch you."
Peter Parker,But you said save the wizard. I cant breathe.
Tony Stark,Youre too high up. Youre running out of air.
Peter Parker,Yeah. That makes sense.
Peter Parker,"Mr Stark, it smells like a new car in here."
Tony Stark,"Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home."
F.R.I.D.A.Y.,Yep.
Peter Parker,"OH, COME ON."
F.R.I.D.A.Y.,"Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts."
Pepper Potts,"Tony. Oh, my God. Are you all right. Whats going on."
Tony Stark,"Yeah, Im fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res."
Pepper Potts,Why.
Tony Stark,Just cause Ill. probably not make it back for a while.
Pepper Potts,Tell me youre not on that ship.
Tony Stark,Yeah.
Pepper Potts,"God, no. Please tell me youre not on that ship."
Tony Stark,"Honey, Im sorry. Im sorry, I dont know what to say."
Pepper Potts,"Come back here, Tony. I swear to God…."
Tony Stark,Pep….
Pepper Potts,Come back here right now. Come back.
F.R.I.D.A.Y.,"Boss, were losing her. Im going, too…."
Peter Parker,Oh my God. I should have stayed on the bus.
Bruce Banner,Where you going.
Wong,The Time Stones been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do.
Bruce Banner,Im gonna make a call.
Peter Quill,"Sing it, Drax."
Rocket,Why are we doing this again.
Gamora,"Its a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying."
Rocket,"I get that, but why are we doing it."
Peter Quill,Cause were nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.
Gamora,Which isnt the point.
Peter Quill,Which isnt the point. I mean… if he doesnt pony up….
Drax,Well take his ship.
Rocket,Exactly.
Peter Quill,B-b-b-bingo.
Mantis,We are arriving.
Peter Quill,"All right, Guardians. Dont forget, this might be dangerous, so lets put on our mean faces. Groot, put that thing away. Now. I dont wanna tell you again. Groot."
Groot,I am Groot.
Peter Quill,Whoa.
Rocket,Language.
Gamora,Hey.
Drax,Wow.
Peter Quill,"You got some acorns on you, kid."
Rocket,"Ever since you got a little sap, youre a total d-hole. Keep it up, and Im gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES."
Mantis,What happened.
Rocket,Looks like were not getting paid.
Rocket,Wipers. Wipers. Get it off.
Peter Quill,How the hell is this dude still alive.
Drax,"He is not a dude. Youre a dude. This. this is a man. A handsome, muscular man."
Peter Quill,Im muscular.
Rocket,"Who are you kidding, Quill. Youre one sandwich away from fat."
Peter Quill,"Yeah, right."
Drax,Its true. You have gained a little weight….
Peter Quill,"What. Gamora, do you think Im…"
Mantis,He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.
Drax,Its like a pirate had a baby with an angel.
Peter Quill,Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. Im gonna get a Bow-flex. Im gonna commit. Im gonna get some dumbbells.
Rocket,"You know you cant eat dumbbells, right."
Gamora,Its like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.
Peter Quill,Stop massaging his muscles. Wake him up.
Mantis,Wake.
Thor,Who the hell are you guys.
Gamora,"The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre."
Drax,Including my own.
Gamora,"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this."
Thor,You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.
Drax,Gamora. is the daughter of Thanos.
Thor,Your father killed my brother.
Peter Quill,"Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do."
Thor,"Families can be tough. Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister. that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so. I had to kill her. Its life, isnt it, I guess. Goes round and round and. I feel your pain."
Peter Quill,"And I feel your pain, as well. I mean its not a competition, but Ive been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--"
Thor,"I need a hammer, not a spoon…. How do I open this thing. Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something…."
Peter Quill,What are you doing.
Thor,Taking your pod.
Peter Quill,"No, youre not. Youll not, be taking our pod today, sir."
Rocket,Quill. Are you making your voice deeper.
Peter Quill,No.
Drax,You are. Youre imitating the god-man. Its weird.
Peter Quill,No Im not.
Mantis,He just did it again.
Peter Quill,This is my voice.
Thor,Are you mocking me.
Peter Quill,Are you mocking me.
Thor,Stop it. You did it again.
Peter Quill,Hes trying to copy me.
Thor,Would you stop doing that. Hes doing it first.
Gamora,Enough. We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where hes going next.
Thor,Knowhere.
Mantis,He must be going somewhere.
Peter Quill,"No. Knowhere. Its a place. Weve been there. It sucks. Excuse me, thats our food."
Thor,Not anymore.
Gamora,Thor… why would he go to Knowhere.
Thor,"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector."
Peter Quill,"If its with the Collector, then its not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone."
Thor,Or a genius.
Gamora,How do you know hes not going for one of the other Stones.
Thor,"Theres six stones out there. Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. Theyre with the Avengers."
Peter Quill,The Avengers.
Thor,Earths Mightiest Heroes.
Mantis,Like Kevin Bacon.
Thor,"He may be on the team. I dont know. Havent been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no ones ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos cant get it. Therefore, hes going to Knowhere. Hence, hell be getting the Reality Stone. Youre welcome."
Gamora,Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
Thor,"Wrong. Where we have to go, is Nivadellir."
Drax,Thats a made up word.
Thor,All words are made up.
Rocket,"Hold up, Nidavellir is real. Seriously. I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please."
Thor,"The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you."
Rocket,Rabbit.
Thor,"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. I assume youre the captain, sir."
Rocket,Youre very perceptive.
Thor,You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir.
Rocket,"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, its me. Yeah, Ill go."
Thor,Wonderful.
Peter Quill,Except for that Im the captain.
Thor,Quiet.
Peter Quill,Thats my backpack.
Rocket,Go sit down.
Peter Quill,"Look, this is my ship. And Im not goin to… Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here."
Thor,The Thanos killing kind.
Peter Quill,Dont you think that we should all have a weapon like that.
Thor,No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.
Rocket,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now.
Thor,A little bit. Yeah.
Gamora,"If we dont go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, hell be too powerful to stop."
Thor,He already is.
Rocket,"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool. Cool."
Thor,So cool.
Peter Quill,For the record… I know that youre only going with him because its where Thanos isnt.
Rocket,"You know, you shouldnt talk that way to your captain, Quill. Come on, Groot. Put that game down, youll rot your brain."
Thor,"I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye."
Vision,
Wanda Maximoff,Vis. Is it the stone again.
Vision,Its as if its speaking to me.
Wanda Maximoff,What does it say.
Vision,I dont. I dont know. But something.
Vision,Tell me what you feel.
Wanda Maximoff,I just feel you.
Wanda Maximoff,So theres a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.
Vision,What if I miss that train.
Wanda Maximoff,There is an 11.
Vision,"What if I missed all the trains. What if this time, I didnt go back."
Wanda Maximoff,You gave Stark your word.
Vision,Id rather give it to you.
Wanda Maximoff,"There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises."
Vision,"Not to each other. Wanda… for two years, weve stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And. I dont know. You know what, Im just gonna speak for myself -- I, I. I think."
Wanda Maximoff,It works.
Vision,It works.
Vision,Then stay. Stay with me.
Vision,Or not. If Im overstepping…
Wanda Maximoff,What are they.
Vision,What the stone was warning me about. I have to go.
Wanda Maximoff,"No, Vision. Vision, if thats true… then maybe going isnt the best idea."
Vision,"Wanda, I…"
Wanda Maximoff,Vision.
Vision,The blade. It stopped me from phasing.
Wanda Maximoff,Is that even possible.
Vision,It isnt supposed to be. My systems are failing. Im beginning to think. we should have stayed in bed.
Wanda Maximoff,Vis.
Corvus Glaive,"Give up the Stone, and she lives."
Wanda Maximoff,Hands off.
Wanda Maximoff,"Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go."
Vision,Please. Please leave.
Wanda Maximoff,You asked me to stay. Im staying.
Vision,Please.
Wanda Maximoff,Get up.
Proxima Midnight,Get up.
Corvus Glaive,I cant.
Natasha Romanoff,We dont wanna kill you. But we will.
Proxima Midnight,Youll never get the chance again.
Sam Wilson,Can you stand.
Vision,"Thank you, Captain."
Steve Rogers,Lets get you on the jet.
Natasha Romanoff,"I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Dont take any chances."
Wanda Maximoff,Im sorry. We just wanted time.
Sam Wilson,"Where to, Cap."
Steve Rogers,Home.
Gamora's Mother,Shh. Well be safe. Well be safe.
Child of Thanos,
Ebony Maw,Zehobereians…
Young Gamora,Mother. Wheres my mother.
Ebony Maw,"Zen-Whoberis. Choose a side, or die."
Young Gamora,Mother.
Ebony Maw,"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few."
Thanos,"Whats wrong, little one."
Young Gamora,My mother. Where is my mother.
Thanos,Whats your name.
Young Gamora,Gamora.
Thanos,"Youre quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. Look. Pretty, isnt it. Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other… Here. You try."
Ebony Maw,"Now go in peace, and meet your Maker."
Thanos,Concentrate. There. Youve got it.
Peter Quill,Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the blow off your junk kind or the gas kind. Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I dont want to--
Gamora,I need to ask a favor.
Peter Quill,"Yeah, sure."
Gamora,"One way or another, the path that were on leads to Thanos."
Peter Quill,Which is what the grenades are for. Im sorry. Whats the favor.
Gamora,If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… youll kill me.
Peter Quill,What.
Gamora,I know something he doesnt. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk.
Peter Quill,What do you know.
Gamora,"If I tell you, youd know, too."
Peter Quill,"If its so important, shouldnt I."
Gamora,Only if you wanna die.
Peter Quill,Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario.
Gamora,"Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me."
Peter Quill,"I mean, Id like to. I really would…"
Gamora,Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.
Peter Quill,Okay.
Peter Quill,Dude. How long have you been standing there.
Drax,An hour.
Peter Quill,An hour. Are you serious.
Drax,Ive mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still. that I become invisible to the eye. watch.
Peter Quill,Youre eating a zarg-nut.
Drax,But my movement. was so slow. that its imperceptible.
Peter Quill,"Mmm, no."
Drax,Im sure Im invisible.
Mantis,"Hi, Drax."
Drax,Damn it.
Peter Quill,This place looks deserted.
Drax,Im reading movement from the third quadrant.
Peter Quill,"Yep. Im picking that up, too. Lets put it down right here."
Collector,I dont have it.
Thanos,Everyone in the Galaxy knows youd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.
Thanos,"I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering."
Collector,I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie.
Thanos,I imagine its like breathing for you.
Collector,Like suicide.
Thanos,So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.
Collector,I didnt know what it was.
Thanos,"Then youre more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Wheres the Stone."
Drax,Today.
Peter Quill,Drax. Drax.
Drax,.He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.
Peter Quill,"Drax, waaaaait. Not yet, not yet, not yet. Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesnt have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah."
Drax,No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.
Mantis,Sleeeep.
Peter Quill,"Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. Im. The other right."
Thanos,Why. Why you. Daughter…
Peter Quill,That was quick.
Collector,Magnificent. Magnificent. Magnificent.
Thanos,"Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter. In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing."
Thanos,"That is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want."
Gamora,You knew Id come.
Thanos,"I counted on it. Theres something we need to discuss, little one."
Drax,Thanos.
Peter Quill,"Let her go, Grimace."
Gamora,Peter…
Peter Quill,I told you to go right.
Gamora,Now. Really.
Peter Quill,You let her go.
Thanos,"Ah, the boyfriend."
Peter Quill,I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.
Gamora,Peter…
Peter Quill,Or Im gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face.
Gamora,Not him.
Gamora,You promised. You promised.
Thanos,"Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. Shes asked, hasnt she. Do it. DO IT."
Peter Quill,I told you to go right.
Gamora,"I love you, more than anything."
Peter Quill,"I love you, too."
Thanos,I like you.
Secretary Ross,Still no word from Vision.
James Rhodes,Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.
Secretary Ross,On a stolen Quinjet with four of the worlds most wanted criminals.
James Rhodes,"You know theyre only criminals because youve chosen to call them that, right, sir."
Secretary Ross,"My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own."
James Rhodes,"If it werent for those Accords, Vision wouldve been right here."
Secretary Ross,"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel."
James Rhodes,Thats right. And Im pretty sure Ive paid for that.
Secretary Ross,You have second thoughts.
James Rhodes,Not anymore.
Steve Rogers,Mr Secretary.
Secretary Ross,You got some nerve. Ill give you that.
Natasha Romanoff,You could use some of that right now.
Secretary Ross,"The worlds on fire. And you think, all is forgiven."
Steve Rogers,"Im not looking for forgiveness. And Im way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So were here to fight. And if you wanna stand in our way. well fight you, too."
Secretary Ross,Arrest them.
James Rhodes,"All over it. Thats a court-martial. Its great to see you, Cap."
Steve Rogers,"You too, Rhodey."
James Rhodes,Well. You guys really look like crap. Mustve been a rough couple of years.
Sam Wilson,"Yeah, well, the hotels werent exactly five star."
Bruce Banner,"Uh, I think you look great. Uh. heh. Yeah. Im back."
Natasha Romanoff,"Hi, Bruce."
Bruce Banner,Nat.
Sam Wilson,This is awkward.
James Rhodes,"So we gotta assume theyre coming back, right."
Wanda Maximoff,And they can clearly find us.
Bruce Banner,We need all hands on deck. Wheres Clint.
Natasha Romanoff,"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, theyre on house arrest."
Bruce Banner,Whos Scott.
Steve Rogers,Ant-Man.
Bruce Banner,"Theres an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man. Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he. he gets. Visions Stone."
Natasha Romanoff,"Well then, we have to protect it."
Vision,"No, we have to destroy it. Ive been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail."
Wanda Maximoff,"And you, with it. Were not having this conversation."
Vision,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos cant get it.
Wanda Maximoff,Thats too high a price.
Vision,Only you have the power to pay it. Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.
Steve Rogers,"But it should. We dont trade lives, Vision."
Vision,"Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different."
Bruce Banner,"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another."
Wanda Maximoff,Youre saying Vision isnt just the stone.
Bruce Banner,"Im saying that if we take out the stone, theres still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts."
Natasha Romanoff,Can we do that.
Bruce Banner,Not me. Not here.
James Rhodes,"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isnt exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back."
Steve Rogers,I know somewhere.
Okoye,"Youll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted."
T'Challa,And the Border Tribe.
Okoye,Those that are left.
T'Challa,Send word to the Jabari as well. MBaku likes a good fight.
Okoye,And what of this one.
T'Challa,This one may be tired of war. But the White Wolf has rested long enough.
Bucky Barnes,Wheres the fight.
T'Challa,On its way.
Ebony Maw,"In all the time Ive served Thanos, Ive never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be. judgement. Give me. the stone."
Tony Stark,"Wow youre a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, arent you."
Peter Parker,"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty."
Tony Stark,What the--
Peter Parker,I know what youre gonna say.
Tony Stark,You should not be here.
Peter Parker,I was gonna go home--
Tony Stark,I dont wanna hear it.
Peter Parker,But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way.
Tony Stark,And now I gotta hear it.
Peter Parker,".And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, its kinda your fault that Im here."
Tony Stark,What did you just say.
Peter Parker,I take that back. And now Im here in space.
Tony Stark,Yeah. Right where I dont want you to be. This isnt Coney Island. This isnt a field trip. Its a one-way ticket. You hear me. Dont pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker,No. I did think this through.
Tony Stark,You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker,"Its just . you cant be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if theres no neighborhood. Okay. That didnt really make any sense, but you know what Im trying to say."
Tony Stark,Come on. We got a situation. See him down there. Hes in trouble. Whats your plan. Go.
Peter Parker,"Um. Okay, okay. uh. Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens."
Ebony Maw,Painful arent they. They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them.
Ebony Maw,.Could end your friends life in an instant.
Tony Stark,"I gotta tell you, hes not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy."
Ebony Maw,Youve saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
Tony Stark,"Yeah, but the kids seen more movies."
Peter Parker,Yes. Wait what are those.
Peter Parker,"Hey, we havent officially met. Cool."
Stephen Strange,Weve gotta turn this ship around.
Tony Stark,Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
Stephen Strange,"No, I want to protect the stone."
Tony Stark,"And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, Im listening."
Stephen Strange,For what. Nearly blasting me into space.
Tony Stark,Who just saved your magical ass. Me.
Stephen Strange,I seriously dont know how you fit your head into that helmet.
Tony Stark,Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
Stephen Strange,"Unlike everyone else in your life, I dont work for you."
Tony Stark,"And due to that fact, were now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup."
Peter Parker,Im backup.
Tony Stark,No. Youre a stowaway. The adults are talking.
Stephen Strange,"Im sorry, Im confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward."
Peter Parker,"No. Im Peter, by the way."
Stephen Strange,Dr Strange.
Peter Parker,"Oh, were using our made-up names. Um. Im Spider-Man, then."
Tony Stark,This ship is self-correcting its course. Things on autopilot.
Stephen Strange,Can we control it. Fly us home. Stark.
Tony Stark,Yeah.
Stephen Strange,Can you get us home.
Tony Stark,Yeah I heard you. Im thinking. Im not so sure we should.
Stephen Strange,Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I dont think you quite understand whats at stake here.
Tony Stark,"No. Its you who doesnt understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now hes back. And I dont know what to do. So Im not so sure if its a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, hes not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur."
Stephen Strange,"Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand. if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone. I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I cant, because the fate of the universe depends on it."
Tony Stark,"Nice. Good. Moral compass. Were straight. Alright, kid. Youre an Avenger now."
Thanos,I thought you might be hungry.
Gamora,I always hated that chair.
Thanos,So Ive been told. Even so. Id hoped youd sit on it one day.
Gamora,I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
Thanos,You told me that too. Every day. For almost twenty years.
Gamora,I was a child when you took me.
Thanos,I saved you.
Gamora,No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
Thanos,"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. Im the one who stopped that. Do you know whats happened since then. The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. Its a paradise."
Gamora,Because you murdered half the planet.
Thanos,A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora,Youre insane.
Thanos,"Little one, its a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction."
Gamora,You dont know that.
Thanos,"Im the only one who knows that. At least, Im the only one with the will to act on it. For a time. you had that same will. as you fought by my side. Daughter."
Gamora,Im not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
Thanos,"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. Thats why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone."
Gamora,Im sorry I disappointed you.
Thanos,I am disappointed. But not because you didnt find it. But because you did. And you lied.
Gamora,Nebula.
Gamora,Dont do this.
Thanos,"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me."
Gamora,Please dont do this.
Thanos,And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.
Gamora,Stop. Stop it. I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.
Memory Nebula,"You know what hes about to do. Hes finally ready, and hes going for the stones. All of them."
Memory Gamora,He can never get them all.
Memory Nebula,He will.
Memory Gamora,"He cant, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it."
Thanos,Youre strong. Me. Youre generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. Thats why youre so bad at it. Where is the Soul Stone.
Gamora,Vormir. The Stone is on Vormir.
Thanos,Show me.
Groot,I am Groot.
Rocket,Tinkle in the cup. Were not looking. Whats there to see. Whats a twig. Everybodys seen a twig.
Groot,I am Groot.
Thor,"Tree, pour whats in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again."
Rocket,You speak Groot.
Thor,"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective."
Groot,I am Groot.
Thor,Youll know when were there. Nivadellirs forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. Its the birth place of my hammer. Its truly awesome.
Rocket,"Okay, time to be the captain. So, dead brother, huh. Yeah, that can be annoying."
Thor,"Well, hes been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true."
Rocket,And you said your sister and your dad.
Thor,Both dead.
Rocket,"Still got a mom, though."
Thor,Killed by a dark elf.
Rocket,A best friend.
Thor,Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket,Are you sure youre up to this particular murder mission.
Thor,"Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret. theyre all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So Im good to go."
Rocket,"Yeah, but this Thanos were talking about. hes the toughest there is."
Thor,"Well, hes never fought me."
Rocket,"Yeah, he has."
Thor,"Hes never fought me twice. And Im getting a new hammer, dont forget."
Rocket,Better be some hammer.
Thor,"You know, Im 1,500 years old. Ive killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. Im only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so."
Rocket,And what if youre wrong.
Thor,If Im wrong then. what more could I lose.
Rocket,I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack. youre gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.
Thor,Whats this.
Rocket,Whats it look like. Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.
Thor,He gave you his eye.
Rocket,He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.
Thor,"Thank you, sweet rabbit."
Rocket,"Hmm. Huh. Oh. I wouldve washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my. Hey, were here."
Thor,I dont think this thing works. Everything seems dark.
Rocket,It aint the eye.
Thor,Somethings wrong. The stars gone out. And the rings are frozen.
Rocket,I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.
Thor,This forge hasnt gone dark in centuries.
Rocket,"You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right."
Thor,Yes. Why.
Rocket,Look anything like that.
Groot,I am Groot.
Thor,Go back to the pod.
Thor,"Eitri, wait. Stop."
Eitri,Thor.
Thor,What happened here.
Eitri,You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us.
Thor,"Asgard is destroyed. Eitri, the glove. What did you do."
Eitri,"300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, theyd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. Your life is yours, he said. But your hands are mine alone."
Thor,"Eitri, this isnt about your hands. Every weapon youve ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - its all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos."
Nebula,"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan."
Peter Parker,"Hey, whats going on."
Stephen Strange,I think were here.
Tony Stark,I dont think this rig has a self-park function. Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand.
Peter Parker,"Yep, got it."
Tony Stark,"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time."
Peter Parker,Okay. Okay. Ready.
Peter Parker,We might wanna turn. Turn. Turn. Turn.
Tony Stark,You alright. That was close. I owe you one.
Peter Parker,"Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, Im sorry."
Tony Stark,I dont wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand.
Peter Parker,Im trying to say that. something is coming.
Drax,THANOS.
Peter Parker,AH. Whoawhoawhoawhoa. PLEASE DONT PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME.
Peter Quill,"Stay down, clown."
Drax,"Die, blanket of death."
Peter Quill,"Alright, everybody, stay where you are. chill the F out. Im gonna ask you this one time. Wheres Gamora."
Tony Stark,"Yeah, Ill do you one better. Whos Gamora."
Drax,Ill do you one better. Why is Gamora.
Peter Quill,"Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, Im gonna French-fry this little freak."
Tony Stark,"Lets do it. You shoot my guy, I blast him. Lets go."
Drax,"Do it, Quill. I can take it."
Mantis,"No, he cant take it."
Stephen Strange,Shes right. You cant.
Peter Quill,Oh yeah. You dont wanna tell me where she is. Thats fine. Ill kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. Starting with you.
Stephen Strange,"Wait, what. Thanos. Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve."
Peter Quill,What master do I serve. What am I supposed to say. Jesus.
Tony Stark,Youre from Earth.
Peter Quill,Im not from Earth. Im from Missouri.
Tony Stark,"Yeah, thats on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for."
Peter Parker,"So, youre not with Thanos."
Peter Quill,"With Thanos. No, Im here to kill Thanos. He took my girl- Wai- who are you."
Peter Parker,"Were the Avengers, man."
Peter Quill,Oh.
Mantis,Youre the ones Thor told us about.
Tony Stark,You know Thor.
Peter Quill,"Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving."
Doctor Strange,Where is he now.
Rocket,This is the plan. Were gonna hit him with a brick.
Eitri,"Its a mold. A kings weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost."
Thor,Did it have a name.
Eitri,Stormbreaker.
Rocket,Thats a bit much.
Thor,So how do we make it.
Eitri,Youll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.
Thor,"Rabbit, fire up the pod."
Peter Quill,The heck happened to this planet. Its eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
Tony Stark,"Yeah, we got one advantage. Hes coming to us. Well use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. Its pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely dont wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet."
Tony Stark,"Are you yawning. In the middle of this, while Im breaking it down. Huh. Did you hear what I said."
Drax,"I stopped listening after you said, We need a plan."
Tony Stark,"Okay, Mr Clean is on his own page."
Peter Quill,"See, not winging it isnt really what they do."
Peter Parker,"Uh, what exactly is it that they do."
Mantis,"Kick names, take ass."
Drax,"Yeah, thats right."
Tony Stark,"Alright, just get over here, please. Mr Lord, can you get your folks to circle up."
Peter Quill,Mr Lord. Star-Lord is fine.
Tony Stark,We gotta coalesce. Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude.
Peter Quill,"Dude, dont call us plucky. We dont know what it means. Alright, were optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good."
Drax,Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Tony Stark,What dance-off.
Peter Quill,Its not a. its not. its nothing.
Peter Parker,"Like in Footloose, the movie."
Peter Quill,Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history.
Peter Parker,It never was.
Tony Stark,"Dont encourage this, alright."
Peter Parker,Okay.
Tony Stark,Were getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
Peter Quill,"Flash Gordon. By the way, thats a compliment. Dont forget, Im half human. So that 50% of me thats stupid. Thats 100% you."
Tony Stark,Your math is blowing my mind.
Mantis,"Excuse me, but. does your friend often do that."
Tony Stark,"Strange, we alright."
Tony Stark,Youre back. Youre alright.
Peter Parker,"Hey, what was that."
Stephen Strange,I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
Peter Quill,How many did you see.
Stephen Strange,"14,000,605."
Tony Stark,How many did we win.
Stephen Strange,One.
Thanos,The stone had better be up there. for your sisters sake.
Stonekeeper,"Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos."
Thanos,You know us.
Stonekeeper,It is my curse to know all who journey here.
Thanos,Wheres the Soul Stone.
Stonekeeper,You should know. it extracts a terrible price.
Thanos,I am prepared.
Stonekeeper,We all think that at first. We are all wrong.
Thanos,How is it you know this place so well.
Red Skull,"A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess."
Red Skull,What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
Thanos,Whats this.
Red Skull,The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
Thanos,Tell me what it needs.
Red Skull,To ensure that whoever possesses it. understands its power. The stone demands a sacrifice.
Thanos,Of what.
Red Skull,"In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul."
Gamora,"All my life, I dreamed of a day. a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now. you kill and torture. and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why. Because you love nothing. No one."
Thanos,
Gamora,Really. Tears.
Red Skull,Theyre not for him.
Gamora,No. This isnt love.
Thanos,"I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. Im sorry, little one."
Gamora,No.
Steve Rogers,"Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0."
Sam Wilson,"I hope youre right about this, Cap. Or were gonna land a lot faster than you want to."
Okoye,When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world. this is not what I imagined.
T'Challa,And what did you imagine.
Okoye,The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.
Bruce Banner,Should we bow.
James Rhodes,"Yeah, hes a king."
Steve Rogers,Seems like Im always thanking you for something.
James Rhodes,What are you doing.
T'Challa,"Uh, we dont do that here. So how big of an assault can we expect."
Bruce Banner,"Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault."
Natasha Romanoff,How we looking.
King T'Challa,"You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and."
Bucky Barnes,"A semi-stable, 100-year-old man."
Steve Rogers,"How you been, Buck."
Bucky Barnes,"Uh, not bad, for the end of the world."
Shuri,Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.
Bruce Banner,"Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially."
Shuri,Why didnt you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively.
Bruce Banner,"Because, we didnt think of it."
Shuri,Im sure you did your best.
Wanda Maximoff,Can you do it.
Shuri,"Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. It will take time, brother."
Steve Rogers,How long.
Shuri,As long as you can give me.
Okoye,Somethings entered the atmosphere.
Sam Wilson,"Hey, Cap, we got a situation here."
Bucky Barnes,"God, I love this place."
James Rhodes,"Yeah, dont start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome."
Vision,Its too late. We need to destroy the stone now.
Natasha Romanoff,"Vision, get your ass back on the table."
T'Challa,We will hold them off.
Steve Rogers,"Wanda, as soon as the stones out of his head. you blow it to hell."
Wanda Maximoff,I will.
T'Challa,Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. And get this man a shield.
Rocket,"I dont think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, youre gonna need something a lot bigger to yank em loose."
Thor,Leave that to me.
Rocket,"Leave that to you. Buddy, youre in space. All you got is a rope and a--"
Thor,Fire the engines.
Rocket,Nnnyah.
Thor,MORE. POWER. RABBIT.
Eitri,"Well done, boy."
Thor,Thats Nivadellir.
Eitri,Damn it.
Rocket,Damn it. Whats damn it.
Eitri,The mechanism is crippled.
Thor,What.
Eitri,With the iris closed I cant heat the metal.
Thor,How long will it take to heat.
Eitri,"A few minutes, maybe more. Why."
Thor,Im gonna hold it open.
Eitri,Thats suicide.
Thor,So is facing Thanos without that ax.
Natasha Romanoff,"How we looking, Bruce."
Bruce Banner,"Yeah, I think Im getting the hang of it. Wow. Its like being the Hulk without actually-- Im okay. Im okay."
James Rhodes,I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.
Jabari Warriors,MIE EFFA. YA HU. MIE EFFA. YA HU. MIE EFFA. YA HU. MIE EFFA. YA HU. MIE EFFA. YA HU.
T'Challa,Thank you for standing with us.
M'Baku,"Of course, brother."
Natasha Romanoff,Wheres your other friend.
Proxima Midnight,You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.
Steve Rogers,Thats not gonna happen.
T'Challa,You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
Proxima Midnight,We. have blood to spare.
Bucky Barnes,Did they surrender.
Steve Rogers,Not exactly.
Bucky Barnes,What the hell.
Natasha Romanoff,Looks like we pissed her off.
Okoye,Theyre killing themselves.
Sam Wilson,You seen the teeth on those things.
James Rhodes,"Alright, back up, Sam. Youre gonna get your wings singed."
Bruce Banner,"Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us. theres nothing between them and Vision."
Steve Rogers,Them we better keep em in front of us.
Okoye,How do we do that.
T'Challa,"We open the barrier. On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen."
Dome Control,"Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier."
T'Challa,On my signal.
M'Baku,This will be the end of Wakanda.
Okoye,Then it will be the noblest ending in history.
T'Challa,WAKANDA FOREVER. Now.
T'Challa,"How much longer, Shuri."
Shuri,"Weve barely begun, brother."
T'Challa,You might want to pick up the pace.
Thor,"Allfathers, give me strength."
Eitri,"You understand, boy. Youre about to take the full force of a star. Itll kill you."
Thor,Only if I die.
Eitri,Yes. Thats what. killing you means.
Eitri,"Hold it. Hold it, Thor."
Rocket,"Thor. Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay."
Rocket,I think hes dying.
Eitri,"He needs the ax. Wheres the handle. Tree, help me find the handle."
Bruce Banner,There’s too many of them. GYAH. AAAAHHHHH.
Bruce Banner,AH-hahaha. You guys are so screwed now.
Thor,BRING ME THANOS.
Stephen Strange,"Oh, yeah, youre much more of a Thanos."
Thanos,"I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission."
Stephen Strange,You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Thanos,And where do you think he brought you.
Stephen Strange,Let me guess. Your home.
Thanos,"It was. And it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution."
Stephen Strange,Genocide.
Thanos,"But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass."
Stephen Strange,Congratulations. Youre a prophet.
Thanos,Im a survivor.
Stephen Strange,Who wants to murder trillions.
Thanos,"With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that. mercy."
Stephen Strange,And then what.
Thanos,I finally rest. and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Stephen Strange,I think. youll find. our will. equal to yours.
Thanos,Ours.
Tony Stark,"Piece of cake, Quill."
Peter Quill,"Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off."
Peter Quill,Boom.
Stephen Strange,Do not let him close his fist.
Peter Parker,Magic. More magic. Magic with a kick. Magic with a--
Thanos,Insect.
Thanos,"Well, well."
Nebula,You should have killed me.
Thanos,It wouldve been a waste of parts.
Nebula,Wheres Gamora.
Tony Stark,Is he under. Dont let up.
Mantis,Be quick. He is very strong.
Tony Stark,"Parker, help. Get over here. She cant hold him much longer. Lets go."
Peter Quill,"I thought youd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh. Where is Gamora."
Thanos,My Gamora.
Peter Quill,"No, bull-shit. Where is she."
Mantis,He is in anguish.
Peter Quill,Good.
Mantis,He… he mourns.
Drax,What does this monster have to mourn.
Nebula,Gamora.
Peter Quill,What.
Nebula,He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone. but she didnt.
Tony Stark,"Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand."
Tony Stark,"Dont, dont, dont engage, weve almost got this off."
Peter Quill,Tell me shes lying. Asshole. Tell me you didnt do it.
Thanos,I. had. to.
Peter Quill,"No, you didnt…. No, you didnt…. NO, YOU DIDNT."
Tony Stark,Quill.
Tony Stark,"Hey, stop. Hey, stop. Stop. Hey, stop. Stop."
Peter Parker,Its coming. Its coming. Its coming. I got it. I got it. .
Peter Parker,"Oh, God."
Rocket,"Come and get some, space dogs. Come on, get some, get some. Come on, get some. How much for the gun."
Bucky Barnes,Not for sale.
Rocket,"Okay, how much for the arm. Oh, Ill get that arm."
Steve Rogers,New haircut.
Thor,Notice youve copied my beard.
Thor,"By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree."
Groot,I AM GROOT.
Steve Rogers,I am Steve Rogers.
T'Challa,Fall back. Fall back now.
James Rhodes,"Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam."
Sam Wilson,Im doing it.
Okoye,Why was she up there all this time.
Proxima Midnight,Shes on the field. Take it.
Sam Wilson,"Guys, we got a Vision situation here."
Steve Rogers,Somebody get to Vision.
Bruce Banner,I got him.
Wanda Maximoff,On my way.
Proxima Midnight,Hell die alone. As will you.
Natasha Romanoff,Shes not alone.
Proxima Midnight,Euuyaaah.
Bruce Banner,"Oh no, oh no you dont. This isnt going to be like New York, pal. This suits already kicked the crap out of the Hulk--"
Bruce Banner,"Guys. Vision needs backup now. Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. Ahhhhh. Hulk. Hulk. HULK."
Hulk,NOOOO.
Bruce Banner,"Oh, screw you, ya big green asshole. Ill do it myself. Come on."
Bruce Banner,"See you later, Alligator. Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal."
Corvus Glaive,"I thought you were formidable, machine. But youre dying, like any man."
Steve Rogers,Get outta here. GO.
Natasha Romanoff,That was really gross.
Steve Rogers,I thought I told you to go.
Vision,"We dont trade lives, Captain."
Peter Parker,I got you. I got you. Im sorry I cant remember anybodys names.
Thanos,"Youre full of tricks, wizard."
Stephen Strange,No.
Thanos,Yet you never once used your greatest weapon. A fake.
Tony Stark,"You throw another moon at me, and Im gonna to lose it."
Thanos,Stark.
Tony Stark,You know me.
Thanos,I do. Youre not the only one cursed with knowledge.
Tony Stark,My only curse is you.
Thanos,Come on.
Thanos,All that for a drop of blood.
Thanos,"You have my respect, Stark. When Im done, half of humanity will still be alive. I hope they remember you."
Stephen Strange,Stop. Spare his life. and I will give you the stone.
Thanos,No tricks.
Tony Stark,Dont.
Thanos,One to go.
Peter Quill,
Peter Quill,Where is he.
Peter Quill,Did we just lose.
Tony Stark,Why would you do that.
Stephen Strange,Were in the Endgame now.
M'Baku,MAYEFA.
Jabari Warriors,YA HU HU.
Wanda Maximoff,Are you okay. What. What is it.
Vision,Hes here.
Steve Rogers,"Everyone, on my position. We have incoming."
Natasha Romanoff,What the hell.
Bruce Banner,Cap. Thats him.
Steve Rogers,Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Vision,Wanda. Its time.
Wanda Maximoff,No.
Vision,"They cant stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone."
Wanda Maximoff,Dont.
Vision,"You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time."
Wanda Maximoff,I cant.
Vision,"Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies."
Wanda Maximoff,Its not fair.
Vision,"It shouldnt be you, but it is. Its all right. You could never hurt me. I just. feel you."
Vision,Its all right. Its all right. I love you.
Thanos,"I understand, my child. Better than anyone."
Wanda Maximoff,You could never.
Thanos,"Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now. is no time at all."
Wanda Maximoff,No.
Thor,I told you. Youd die for that.
