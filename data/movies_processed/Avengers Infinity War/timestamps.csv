he can do it with the snapof his fingers like this.,"00:31:08,660 "," 00:31:10,870"
You seem to knowa great deal about Thanos.,"00:31:11,871 "," 00:31:14,457"
Gamorais the daughter of Thanos.,"00:31:14,624 "," 00:31:18,419"
Your father killed my brother.,"00:31:22,465 "," 00:31:24,551"
"Oh, boy.","00:31:24,884 "," 00:31:26,094"
"Stepfather, technically.","00:31:26,261 "," 00:31:27,929"
And she hates himas much as you do.,"00:31:28,096 "," 00:31:30,014"
Families can be tough.,"00:31:33,726 "," 00:31:35,270"
"Before my father died,","00:31:35,436 "," 00:31:36,771"
he told methat I had a halfsister...,"00:31:36,854 "," 00:31:38,606"
that he imprisoned in Hel.,"00:31:38,773 "," 00:31:41,025"
And then she returned homeand stabbed me in the eye.,"00:31:41,192 "," 00:31:44,153"
So I had to kill her.,"00:31:44,320 "," 00:31:45,613"
"That's life though,isn't it, I guess.","00:31:45,780 "," 00:31:47,824"
Goes round and round and...,"00:31:47,907 "," 00:31:49,158"
I feel your pain.,"00:31:49,993 "," 00:31:50,994"
"I feel your pain as well,because...","00:31:51,160 "," 00:31:53,454"
"I mean,it's not a competition,","00:31:53,621 "," 00:31:54,789"
but I've been through a lot.,"00:31:54,872 "," 00:31:55,999"
My father killed my mother.,"00:31:56,165 "," 00:31:57,834"
And then I had to killmy father.,"00:31:58,001 "," 00:31:59,127"
That was hard.,"00:31:59,210 "," 00:32:00,712"
Probably even harderthan having to kill a sister.,"00:32:00,878 "," 00:32:03,756"
"Plus, I came out withboth my eyes, which was...","00:32:04,299 "," 00:32:07,176"
"I need a hammer, not a spoon.","00:32:07,343 "," 00:32:09,053"
"How do I open this thing?Is there some sort of, uh...","00:32:10,888 "," 00:32:13,975"
"A 4digit code, maybe?Maybe a birthdate.","00:32:14,517 "," 00:32:17,061"
" Uh, what are you doing? Taking your pod.","00:32:17,145 "," 00:32:20,523"
"No, you're not.","00:32:21,983 "," 00:32:23,026"
"You will not be takingour pod today, sir.","00:32:25,153 "," 00:32:29,032"
"Uh... Quill, are you makingyour voice deeper?","00:32:29,532 "," 00:32:32,910"
 No. You are.,"00:32:34,829 "," 00:32:36,456"
You're imitating the godman.It's weird.,"00:32:36,623 "," 00:32:39,334"
"No, I'm not.","00:32:39,500 "," 00:32:40,668"
 He just did it again! This is my voice.,"00:32:40,835 "," 00:32:42,879"
Are you mocking me?,"00:32:49,052 "," 00:32:50,053"
 Are you mocking me? Stop it. You did it again.,"00:32:50,511 "," 00:32:53,431"
He's trying to copy me.,"00:32:53,931 "," 00:32:54,932"
I need you to stop doing that.,"00:32:55,016 "," 00:32:56,017"
 Enough! He's doing it first.,"00:32:56,184 "," 00:32:57,810"
We need to stop Thanos.,"00:32:57,977 "," 00:32:59,354"
Which meanswe need to find out,"00:32:59,520 "," 00:33:01,064"
where he's going next.,"00:33:01,147 "," 00:33:02,148"
Knowhere.,"00:33:02,315 "," 00:33:03,566"
He must be going somewhere.,"00:33:03,733 "," 00:33:05,401"
"No, no. Knowhere?","00:33:05,568 "," 00:33:07,570"
It's a place.We've been there. It sucks.,"00:33:07,737 "," 00:33:10,406"
" Excuse me, that's our food. Not anymore.","00:33:10,573 "," 00:33:12,992"
"Thor, why would hego to Knowhere?","00:33:13,409 "," 00:33:16,579"
Because for years...,"00:33:16,746 "," 00:33:17,914"
the Reality Stone's beensafely stored there,"00:33:18,081 "," 00:33:20,249"
with a mancalled the Collector.,"00:33:20,333 "," 00:33:21,751"
"If it's with theCollector, then it's not safe.","00:33:21,918 "," 00:33:23,503"
Only an idiotwould give that man a stone.,"00:33:23,670 "," 00:33:25,463"
 Or a genius. How do you know...,"00:33:25,546 "," 00:33:26,923"
he's not goingfor one of the other stones?,"00:33:27,090 "," 00:33:29,634"
There are six stonesout there.,"00:33:29,801 "," 00:33:32,178"
Thanos already hasthe Power Stone...,"00:33:32,345 "," 00:33:34,555"
because he stole it last weekwhen he decimated Xandar.,"00:33:34,722 "," 00:33:38,017"
He stole the Space Stonefrom me...,"00:33:38,476 "," 00:33:40,520"
when he destroyed my ship andslaughtered half my people.,"00:33:40,687 "," 00:33:43,356"
The Time and Mind Stonesare safe on Earth.,"00:33:43,523 "," 00:33:45,149"
They're with the Avengers.,"00:33:45,233 "," 00:33:46,234"
 The Avengers? Earth's mightiest heroes.,"00:33:46,567 "," 00:33:48,820"
Like Kevin Bacon?,"00:33:48,986 "," 00:33:50,113"
He may be on the team.I don't know.,"00:33:50,279 "," 00:33:51,572"
I haven't been therein a while.,"00:33:51,656 "," 00:33:52,657"
"As for the Soul Stone, well,no one's ever seen that.","00:33:52,824 "," 00:33:55,034"
No one even knows where it is.,"00:33:55,201 "," 00:33:56,828"
Therefore Thanos can't get it.,"00:33:56,994 "," 00:33:58,746"
Therefore he's goingto Knowhere.,"00:33:58,830 "," 00:34:00,289"
Hence he'll be gettingthe Reality Stone.,"00:34:00,456 "," 00:34:02,875"
You're welcome.,"00:34:03,042 "," 00:34:04,085"
Then we have to goto Knowhere now.,"00:34:04,252 "," 00:34:05,461"
Wrong. Where we have to gois Nidavellir.,"00:34:05,628 "," 00:34:09,298"
 That's a madeup word. All words are made up.,"00:34:09,757 "," 00:34:11,592"
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?,"00:34:11,759 "," 00:34:14,846"
That place is a legend.,"00:34:15,012 "," 00:34:16,639"
"They make the most powerful,horrific weapons","00:34:16,806 "," 00:34:18,224"
to ever torment the universe.,"00:34:18,307 "," 00:34:20,351"
"I would very much liketo go there, please.","00:34:20,518 "," 00:34:22,562"
The rabbit is correct,"00:34:22,729 "," 00:34:23,730"
and clearly the smartestamong you.,"00:34:23,813 "," 00:34:24,814"
Rabbit?,"00:34:24,939 "," 00:34:25,982"
Only Eitri the Dwarf canmake me the weapon I need.,"00:34:26,149 "," 00:34:28,401"
"I assumeyou're the captain, sir.","00:34:28,568 "," 00:34:29,777"
You're very perceptive.,"00:34:29,944 "," 00:34:30,945"
You seem like a noble leader.,"00:34:31,112 "," 00:34:32,321"
Will you join meon my quest to Nidavellir?,"00:34:32,405 "," 00:34:33,990"
"Let me just ask the captain.Oh, wait a second, it's me!","00:34:34,157 "," 00:34:36,951"
 Yeah. I'll go. Wonderful!,"00:34:37,118 "," 00:34:38,870"
"Uh, except for thatI'm the captain.","00:34:39,036 "," 00:34:40,163"
Quiet.,"00:34:40,246 "," 00:34:41,247"
 That's my backpack. Go sit down.,"00:34:41,330 "," 00:34:42,915"
"Look, this is my ship.","00:34:43,082 "," 00:34:44,709"
And I'm not goin' to...,"00:34:44,876 "," 00:34:46,627"
"Wait, what kinda weaponare we talkin' about here?","00:34:47,628 "," 00:34:49,714"
The Thanoskilling kind.,"00:34:49,881 "," 00:34:51,132"
Don't you think that we shouldall have a weapon like that?,"00:34:51,966 "," 00:34:53,468"
No. You simply lackthe strength to wield them.,"00:34:53,634 "," 00:34:55,678"
Your bodies would crumble,"00:34:55,845 "," 00:34:56,929"
as your minds collapsedinto madness.,"00:34:57,013 "," 00:34:58,181"
Is it weird that I wanna do iteven more now?,"00:34:58,347 "," 00:35:00,266"
"Mmm, a little bit, yeah.","00:35:00,433 "," 00:35:01,601"
If we don't go to Knowhere,"00:35:01,768 "," 00:35:03,019"
and Thanos retrievesanother stone...,"00:35:03,102 "," 00:35:04,687"
he'll be too powerful to stop.,"00:35:04,854 "," 00:35:06,397"
 He already is. I got it figured out.,"00:35:06,564 "," 00:35:08,733"
We got two ships,"00:35:08,900 "," 00:35:10,610"
and a large assortmentof morons.,"00:35:10,693 "," 00:35:12,069"
So me and Groot will gowith the pirate angel here.,"00:35:12,236 "," 00:35:15,490"
And the moronswill go to Knowhere,"00:35:15,656 "," 00:35:16,824"
to try to stop Thanos.,"00:35:16,908 "," 00:35:18,493"
 Cool? Cool. So cool.,"00:35:18,659 "," 00:35:20,578"
For the record...,"00:35:20,745 "," 00:35:22,038"
I know thatyou're going with him,"00:35:22,789 "," 00:35:24,123"
because it's whereThanos isn't.,"00:35:24,207 "," 00:35:25,291"
"You know, you really shouldn't","00:35:25,458 "," 00:35:26,959"
"talk that wayto your captain, Quill.","00:35:27,043 "," 00:35:29,170"
"Come on, Groot.","00:35:30,129 "," 00:35:31,464"
Put that game down.You'll rot your brain.,"00:35:32,006 "," 00:35:34,717"
"I bid you farewelland good luck, morons.","00:35:38,429 "," 00:35:41,265"
Bye.,"00:35:41,432 "," 00:35:42,558"
Vis?,"00:35:57,323 "," 00:35:58,449"
Is it the stone again?,"00:35:58,908 "," 00:36:00,827"
It's as ifit's speaking to me.,"00:36:00,993 "," 00:36:02,620"
What does it say?,"00:36:03,246 "," 00:36:04,956"
"I don't... I don't know,but something.","00:36:05,873 "," 00:36:08,209"
Hey.,"00:36:09,794 "," 00:36:11,671"
Tell me what you feel.,"00:36:21,514 "," 00:36:24,016"
I just feel you.,"00:36:31,023 "," 00:36:33,734"
So there's a 10:00 a.m.to Glasgow...,"00:36:41,909 "," 00:36:43,828"
which would give us more timetogether before you went back.,"00:36:43,995 "," 00:36:45,997"
What ifI miss that train?,"00:36:46,163 "," 00:36:47,623"
There's an 11:00.,"00:36:47,790 "," 00:36:48,791"
What if I missedall the trains?,"00:36:48,958 "," 00:36:51,377"
What if this timeI didn't go back?,"00:36:52,753 "," 00:36:54,463"
But you gave Stark your word.,"00:36:54,630 "," 00:36:55,965"
I'd rather give it to you.,"00:36:56,132 "," 00:36:57,300"
"Well, there are people who areexpecting me too, you know.","00:36:57,466 "," 00:36:59,427"
We both made promises.,"00:36:59,594 "," 00:37:00,928"
Not to each other.,"00:37:01,095 "," 00:37:02,805"
Wanda.,"00:37:03,222 "," 00:37:04,223"
"For 2 years,we've stolen these moments...","00:37:05,182 "," 00:37:07,518"
trying to seeif this could work and...,"00:37:07,685 "," 00:37:09,729"
I don't know.,"00:37:09,896 "," 00:37:11,480"
"You know what, I'm justgonna speak for myself.","00:37:11,647 "," 00:37:13,608"
I think...,"00:37:13,691 "," 00:37:15,484"
 It works. It works.,"00:37:15,651 "," 00:37:16,736"
It works.,"00:37:16,903 "," 00:37:18,195"
Stay.,"00:37:20,656 "," 00:37:21,908"
Stay with me.,"00:37:22,825 "," 00:37:24,493"
Or not. If I'm overstepping...,"00:37:29,248 "," 00:37:32,501"
What are they?,"00:37:39,550 "," 00:37:41,302"
What the stonewas warning me about.,"00:37:41,636 "," 00:37:44,055"
I have to go.,"00:37:54,023 "," 00:37:55,358"
"No, Vision.","00:37:55,441 "," 00:37:56,442"
"Vision, if that's true,","00:37:57,068 "," 00:37:58,319"
then maybegoing isn't the best idea.,"00:37:58,402 "," 00:38:01,197"
"Wanda, I...","00:38:02,239 "," 00:38:03,324"
Vision!,"00:38:03,491 "," 00:38:05,534"
"The blade,it stopped me from phasing.","00:38:33,688 "," 00:38:36,357"
 Is that even possible? It isn't supposed to be.,"00:38:37,274 "," 00:38:39,235"
My systems are failing.,"00:38:40,319 "," 00:38:42,029"
I'm beginning to thinkwe should have stayed in bed.,"00:38:42,947 "," 00:38:45,616"
Vis!,"00:38:48,160 "," 00:38:49,370"
"Give up the stone,and she lives.","00:38:58,254 "," 00:39:01,632"
Hands off.,"00:39:39,754 "," 00:39:40,963"

 Get up. I can't.,"00:41:24,900 "," 00:41:26,610"
"We don't wanna kill you,but we will.","00:41:26,777 "," 00:41:29,488"
You'll never getthe chance again.,"00:41:29,655 "," 00:41:31,824"
Can you stand?,"00:41:47,798 "," 00:41:49,341"
"Thank you, Captain.","00:41:54,096 "," 00:41:55,514"
Let's get you on the jet.,"00:41:58,225 "," 00:41:59,852"
"Now, I thought we had a deal.","00:42:03,814 "," 00:42:07,234"

are the blowoffyourjunkkind or the gas kind?,"00:44:33,881 "," 00:44:36,050"

"Yeah, sure.","00:44:42,389 "," 00:44:43,724"
"One way or another,","00:44:45,267 "," 00:44:46,352"
the path that we're onleads to Thanos.,"00:44:46,435 "," 00:44:48,687"
Which is whatthe grenades are for.,"00:44:50,439 "," 00:44:51,940"
"Uh, I'm sorry.What's the favor?","00:44:52,858 "," 00:44:55,194"
If things go wrong...,"00:44:57,529 "," 00:44:58,530"
If Thanos gets me...,"00:45:00,115 "," 00:45:02,284"
I want you to promise me...,"00:45:06,830 "," 00:45:08,791"

the entire universecould be at risk.,"00:45:23,097 "," 00:45:24,473"
What do you know?,"00:45:25,140 "," 00:45:26,225"
"If I tell you, you'd know too.","00:45:26,392 "," 00:45:28,435"
If it's so important...,"00:45:31,480 "," 00:45:33,315"

Only if you wanna die.,"00:45:34,608 "," 00:45:35,818"
Why does somebody alwayshave to die in this scenario?,"00:45:35,984 "," 00:45:37,569"
Just...,"00:45:38,987 "," 00:45:39,988"
Trust me.And possibly kill me.,"00:45:42,408 "," 00:45:45,411"

An hour.,"00:46:31,290 "," 00:46:32,291"
An hour?,"00:46:32,833 "," 00:46:34,084"
Are you serious?,"00:46:34,626 "," 00:46:35,919"
I've mastered the ability,"00:46:36,086 "," 00:46:38,255"
of standingso incredibly still...,"00:46:38,338 "," 00:46:41,008"

You're eating a zargnut.,"00:46:50,350 "," 00:46:51,935"
But my movement...,"00:46:52,394 "," 00:46:53,812"
was so slow...,"00:46:54,646 "," 00:46:56,273"
that it's imperceptible.,"00:46:57,107 "," 00:46:58,942"

"In my heart,I knew you still cared.","00:50:56,430 "," 00:50:58,932"
But one never knows for sure.,"00:51:06,314 "," 00:51:09,568"
Reality is oftendisappointing.,"00:51:18,785 "," 00:51:21,621"
"That is, it was.","00:51:24,791 "," 00:51:27,043"

No.,"00:52:14,716 "," 00:52:15,717"

You expect too much from him.,"00:52:48,792 "," 00:52:51,294"
"She's asked, hasn't she?","00:52:54,881 "," 00:52:56,466"
Do it.,"00:53:00,428 "," 00:53:01,429"

"I remember your signatureon those papers, Colonel.","00:54:33,021 "," 00:54:36,232"
That's right.,"00:54:36,733 "," 00:54:37,734"
And I'm pretty sureI paid for that.,"00:54:39,736 "," 00:54:41,571"

This is awkward.,"00:56:22,756 "," 00:56:24,299"
"So we gotta assumethey're coming back, right?","00:56:26,801 "," 00:56:28,344"
And they can clearly find us.,"00:56:28,511 "," 00:56:29,679"
We need all hands on deck.Where's Clint?,"00:56:29,846 "," 00:56:32,057"
"After the wholeAccords situation,","00:56:32,348 "," 00:56:33,808"

on their families.They're on house arrest.,"00:56:35,602 "," 00:56:37,145"

There's an AntManand a SpiderMan?,"00:56:38,730 "," 00:56:40,190"
"Okay, look.","00:56:41,107 "," 00:56:42,150"
Thanos has the biggest armyin the universe...,"00:56:42,233 "," 00:56:45,070"
and he is not gonna stopuntil he gets...,"00:56:45,236 "," 00:56:48,656"
Vision's stone.,"00:56:50,492 "," 00:56:51,534"
Then we have to protect it.,"00:56:51,701 "," 00:56:52,952"
"No, we have to destroy it.","00:56:53,119 "," 00:56:54,746"
I've been givinga good deal of thought,"00:56:56,915 "," 00:56:58,208"
to this entity in my head.,"00:56:58,291 "," 00:56:59,292"
About its nature.,"00:56:59,459 "," 00:57:00,960"
But also its composition.,"00:57:01,503 "," 00:57:03,671"
I think if it were exposed,"00:57:03,838 "," 00:57:05,840"
to a sufficiently powerfulenergy source...,"00:57:05,924 "," 00:57:07,759"

We're not havingthis conversation.,"00:57:18,770 "," 00:57:20,230"
Eliminating the stoneis the only way,"00:57:20,396 "," 00:57:22,398"
to be certain thatThanos can't get it.,"00:57:22,482 "," 00:57:24,484"
That's too high a price.,"00:57:25,026 "," 00:57:27,237"
Only you havethe power to pay it.,"00:57:31,741 "," 00:57:34,119"

"Tell me,why is this any different?","00:57:52,846 "," 00:57:54,889"
Because you mighthave a choice.,"00:57:55,056 "," 00:57:57,350"

Perhaps the best parts.,"00:58:16,744 "," 00:58:18,204"
Can we do that?,"00:58:18,538 "," 00:58:19,873"

"Yeah, I heard you.","01:03:46,574 "," 01:03:47,825"
I'm thinking I'm notso sure we should.,"01:03:49,118 "," 01:03:51,579"

that Thanos has beeninside my head for 6 years.,"01:04:01,464 "," 01:04:04,217"
Since he sent an armyto New York,"01:04:04,383 "," 01:04:05,968"

And I don't know what to do.,"01:04:07,762 "," 01:04:09,680"
So I'm not so sure,"01:04:09,847 "," 01:04:11,015"
if it's a better plan to fighthim on our turf or his...,"01:04:11,098 "," 01:04:12,892"
"but you saw what they did,what they can do.","01:04:13,059 "," 01:04:16,687"
"At least on his turf,he's not expecting it.","01:04:16,854 "," 01:04:19,065"
So I say we takethe fight to him.,"01:04:19,232 "," 01:04:21,984"
