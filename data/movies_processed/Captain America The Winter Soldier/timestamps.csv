"That photo was taken5 years after Nick and I met,","00:41:51,533 "," 00:41:54,013"
when I was at State Departmentin Bogota.,"00:41:54,253 "," 00:41:56,620"
"E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,","00:41:56,813 "," 00:41:59,293"
"and security got me out,but the rebels took hostages.","00:41:59,493 "," 00:42:03,737"
"Nick was Deputy Chiefof the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,","00:42:04,213 "," 00:42:07,422"
and he comes to me with a plan.,"00:42:07,573 "," 00:42:08,904"
He wants to storm the buildingthrough the sewers.,"00:42:09,093 "," 00:42:11,108"
"I said, No, we'll negotiate.","00:42:11,133 "," 00:42:13,898"
"Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,so they put out a kill order.","00:42:14,933 "," 00:42:18,460"
"They stormed the basement,and what do they find?","00:42:18,693 "," 00:42:20,821"
They find it empty.,"00:42:21,013 "," 00:42:22,424"
"Nick had ignored my direct order,","00:42:23,693 "," 00:42:25,536"
"and carried out an unauthorisedmilitary operation on foreign soil,","00:42:25,733 "," 00:42:29,055"
"and saved the lives ofa dozen political officers,","00:42:29,773 "," 00:42:31,855"
including my daughter.,"00:42:32,173 "," 00:42:33,299"
So you gave him a promotion.,"00:42:33,453 "," 00:42:35,023"
I've never had any cause to regret it.,"00:42:35,253 "," 00:42:36,778"
"Captain, why was Nickin your apartment last night?","00:42:39,013 "," 00:42:41,095"
I don't know.,"00:42:45,173 "," 00:42:46,254"
Did you know it was bugged?,"00:42:47,493 "," 00:42:48,824"
"I did, because Nick told me.","00:42:49,733 "," 00:42:52,054"
Did he tell youhe was the one who bugged it?,"00:42:52,533 "," 00:42:55,013"
I want you to see something.,"00:43:01,773 "," 00:43:02,979"
"Who hired you, Batroc?","00:43:03,933 "," 00:43:05,373"
Is that live?,"00:43:05,493 "," 00:43:06,415"
"Yeah, they picked him up last nightin a notsosafe house in Algiers.","00:43:06,813 "," 00:43:10,181"
Are you saying he's a suspect?,"00:43:11,293 "," 00:43:12,828"
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.,"00:43:12,853 "," 00:43:14,503"
"No, no.It's more complicated than that.","00:43:14,893 "," 00:43:17,499"
Batroc was hired anonymouslyto attack the Lemurian Star.,"00:43:17,653 "," 00:43:20,259"
"And he was contacted by emailand paid by wire transfer,","00:43:20,453 "," 00:43:23,935"
and then the money was run through17 fictitious accounts.,"00:43:24,653 "," 00:43:28,544"
The last one going toa holding company,"00:43:29,173 "," 00:43:31,016"
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.,"00:43:31,173 "," 00:43:33,380"
Am I supposed to know who that is?,"00:43:33,573 "," 00:43:34,933"
Not likely. Veech died 6 years ago.,"00:43:35,093 "," 00:43:37,095"
His last address was1435 Elmhurst Drive.,"00:43:37,493 "," 00:43:40,224"
"When I first met Nick,his mother lived at 1437.","00:43:40,973 "," 00:43:44,261"
Are you sayingFury hired the pirates? Why?,"00:43:45,933 "," 00:43:49,221"
The prevailing theory,"00:43:49,733 "," 00:43:51,417"
was that the hijacking wasa cover for the acquisition,"00:43:52,493 "," 00:43:55,303"
and sale of classified intelligence.,"00:43:55,493 "," 00:43:57,860"
The sale went sourand that led to Nick's death.,"00:43:59,693 "," 00:44:02,503"
"If you really knew Nick Fury,you'd know that's not true.","00:44:05,653 "," 00:44:08,418"
Why do you think we're talking?,"00:44:09,653 "," 00:44:11,735"
"See, I took a seat on the Councilnot because I wanted to,","00:44:15,373 "," 00:44:17,944"
"but because Nick asked me to,because we were both realists.","00:44:18,133 "," 00:44:21,899"
"We knew that, despite all the diplomacyand the handshaking and the rhetoric,","00:44:23,373 "," 00:44:27,697"
to build a really better world,"00:44:28,533 "," 00:44:30,900"
sometimes means havingto tear the old one down.,"00:44:31,613 "," 00:44:34,776"
And that makes enemies.,"00:44:37,013 "," 00:44:38,458"
Those people that call you dirtybecause you got the guts,"00:44:40,733 "," 00:44:43,623"
to stick your hands in the mudand try to build something better.,"00:44:43,813 "," 00:44:46,578"
And the idea that those peoplecould be happy today,"00:44:47,973 "," 00:44:50,658"
"makes me really, really angry.","00:44:52,133 "," 00:44:54,579"
"Captain, you were the lastone to see Nick alive.","00:44:58,653 "," 00:45:00,908"
I don't think that's an accident.,"00:45:00,933 "," 00:45:02,935"
"And I don't think you do, either.","00:45:03,493 "," 00:45:05,097"
"So, I'm gonna ask again.","00:45:07,333 "," 00:45:09,142"
Why was he there?,"00:45:09,533 "," 00:45:11,342"
He told me not to trust anyone.,"00:45:14,253 "," 00:45:16,574"
I wonder if that included him.,"00:45:18,813 "," 00:45:21,020"
I'm sorry.,"00:45:25,853 "," 00:45:27,139"

You met him earlier this weekon another assignment.,"01:28:41,773 "," 01:28:44,060"
I knew him.,"01:28:47,133 "," 01:28:48,464"
Your work has been a gift to mankind.,"01:28:57,053 "," 01:28:59,738"

"But, if you don't do your part,I can't do mine.","01:29:15,533 "," 01:29:18,742"
And HYDRA can't give the worldthe freedom it deserves.,"01:29:20,413 "," 01:29:23,257"

You gave me this mission.This is how it ends.,"01:31:21,853 "," 01:31:24,060"
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.You said so yourself.,"01:31:24,173 "," 01:31:26,293"
HYDRA grew right under your noseand nobody noticed.,"01:31:26,493 "," 01:31:28,222"
Why do you think we're meetingin this cave? I noticed.,"01:31:28,373 "," 01:31:31,536"
How many paid the pricebefore you did?,"01:31:31,893 "," 01:31:33,577"
"Look, I didn't know about Barnes.","01:31:36,613 "," 01:31:38,377"
"Even if you had,would you have told me?","01:31:38,573 "," 01:31:40,453"

I know.,"01:33:21,053 "," 01:33:22,100"
"Look, whoever he used to beand the guy he is now,","01:33:22,973 "," 01:33:26,341"
I don't think he's the kind you save.,"01:33:26,973 "," 01:33:29,180"
He's the kind you stop.,"01:33:29,373 "," 01:33:30,818"
I don't know if I can do that.,"01:33:33,493 "," 01:33:35,097"
"Well, he might not give you a choice.","01:33:35,413 "," 01:33:37,381"
He doesn't know you.,"01:33:37,573 "," 01:33:39,063"
He will.,"01:33:39,773 "," 01:33:40,820"
Gear up. It's time.,"01:33:43,573 "," 01:33:44,859"
You gonna wear that?,"01:33:47,493 "," 01:33:48,619"
"No. If you're gonna fight a war,you got to wear a uniform.","01:33:48,853 "," 01:33:52,221"
"Oh, man.","01:34:00,133 "," 01:34:01,578"
I am so fired.,"01:34:02,373 "," 01:34:04,455"

And these will give youunrestricted access.,"01:34:55,853 "," 01:34:58,743"
I've been parking there for 2 months.,"01:35:02,693 "," 01:35:03,899"
But it's his spot.So where's he been?,"01:35:04,093 "," 01:35:05,697"
I think Afghanistan.,"01:35:05,893 "," 01:35:07,188"

and some of you would have gladlykicked me out of the car along the way.,"01:35:28,613 "," 01:35:31,935"
"Finally, we're here.","01:35:34,213 "," 01:35:35,180"
And the world should be grateful.,"01:35:35,893 "," 01:35:37,816"

You've heard a lot about meover the last few days.,"01:35:44,253 "," 01:35:46,460"
Some of you were even orderedto hunt me down.,"01:35:47,493 "," 01:35:49,780"
But I think it's time you know the truth.,"01:35:50,453 "," 01:35:53,343"
S.H.I.E.L.D. is notwhat we thought it was.,"01:35:56,493 "," 01:35:58,655"
It's been taken over by HYDRA.,"01:35:58,853 "," 01:36:00,582"
Alexander Pierce is their leader.,"01:36:01,693 "," 01:36:03,377"

They could be standingright next to you.,"01:36:15,173 "," 01:36:17,062"
They almost have what they want.,"01:36:18,613 "," 01:36:20,297"
Absolute control.,"01:36:21,093 "," 01:36:23,175"
They shot Nick Fury.,"01:36:23,653 "," 01:36:25,018"
And it won't end there.,"01:36:26,133 "," 01:36:27,259"
"If you launch those helicarriers today,","01:36:27,813 "," 01:36:30,020"
HYDRA will be able to killanyone that stands in their way.,"01:36:30,173 "," 01:36:32,493"
Unless we stop them.,"01:36:35,453 "," 01:36:36,864"

But the price of freedom is high.It always has been.,"01:36:43,893 "," 01:36:47,056"
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.,"01:36:47,813 "," 01:36:49,702"
"And if I'm the only one, then so be it.","01:36:52,053 "," 01:36:54,863"
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.,"01:36:56,533 "," 01:36:58,297"
"Did you write that down first,or was it off the top of your head?","01:37:03,053 "," 01:37:06,341"
You smug son of a bitch.,"01:37:06,853 "," 01:37:08,457"
Arrest him.,"01:37:12,533 "," 01:37:13,614"
I guess I've got the floor.,"01:37:16,453 "," 01:37:18,103"

I'm not dead yet.,"01:40:24,133 "," 01:40:25,658"
Let me ask you a question.,"01:40:32,613 "," 01:40:34,377"
What if Pakistan marchedinto Mumbai tomorrow,"01:40:36,893 "," 01:40:40,022"
and you knew that they weregoing to drag your daughters,"01:40:41,293 "," 01:40:43,493"
"into a soccer stadium for execution,","01:40:43,653 "," 01:40:46,418"

Wouldn't you?,"01:40:52,413 "," 01:40:53,574"
Wouldn't you all?,"01:40:53,773 "," 01:40:55,423"
