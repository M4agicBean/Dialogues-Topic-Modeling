Did you bring Auntie Nat?,"01:01:14,080 "," 01:01:16,447"
Why don't you hug her and find out?,"01:01:16,680 "," 01:01:19,763"
" Sorry for barging in on you. Yeah, we would have called ahead,","01:01:20,560 "," 01:01:22,801"
but we were busy havingno idea that you existed.,"01:01:22,920 "," 01:01:24,922"
"Yeah, well, Fury helped meset this up when I joined.","01:01:25,280 "," 01:01:28,250"
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.I'd like to keep it that way.,"01:01:29,080 "," 01:01:31,725"
I figure it's a good place to lay low.,"01:01:32,480 "," 01:01:34,209"
Honey.,"01:01:34,320 "," 01:01:35,765"

Thor?,"01:02:03,680 "," 01:02:04,841"
I saw something in that dream.,"01:02:04,960 "," 01:02:06,803"
I need answers. I won't find them here.,"01:02:06,920 "," 01:02:09,526"
We can go home.,"01:02:20,080 "," 01:02:21,366"
See? You worried for nothing.,"01:02:32,880 "," 01:02:34,723"
"Can't even feel the difference, can you?","01:02:34,840 "," 01:02:36,968"
"If they're sleeping here,","01:02:39,320 "," 01:02:40,526"
some of themare gonna have to double up.,"01:02:40,680 "," 01:02:42,523"
"Yeah, that's not gonna sell.","01:02:44,600 "," 01:02:46,728"
What about Nat and Dr Banner?,"01:02:49,560 "," 01:02:51,881"
How long has that been going on?,"01:02:52,320 "," 01:02:54,243"
Has what?,"01:02:54,760 "," 01:02:56,808"
You are so cute.,"01:02:56,960 "," 01:02:58,689"
Nat and Banner?,"01:02:58,920 "," 01:03:00,365"
"I'll explain when you're older,","01:03:01,080 "," 01:03:02,491"
" Hawkeye. Well, okay.","01:03:02,680 "," 01:03:05,365"
"It's bad, right?","01:03:07,320 "," 01:03:08,731"
Nat seems really shaken.,"01:03:09,080 "," 01:03:10,241"
Ultron has these allies.,"01:03:11,720 "," 01:03:13,210"
"These kids. They're punks, really.","01:03:13,320 "," 01:03:17,250"
"But they carry a big, damn stick.","01:03:18,960 "," 01:03:21,406"
And Nat took a serious hit.,"01:03:21,520 "," 01:03:22,726"
Someone's gonna have toteach them some manners.,"01:03:23,920 "," 01:03:26,400"
That someone being you.,"01:03:26,600 "," 01:03:28,409"
You knowI totally support your avenging.,"01:03:29,720 "," 01:03:32,564"
I couldn't be prouder.,"01:03:32,680 "," 01:03:34,523"
But I see those guys...,"01:03:36,080 "," 01:03:37,411"
Those gods...,"01:03:37,600 "," 01:03:39,568"
You don't think they need me.,"01:03:41,560 "," 01:03:43,289"
"I think they do, which is a lot scarier.","01:03:43,960 "," 01:03:47,601"
They're a mess.,"01:03:48,760 "," 01:03:50,569"
Yeah.,"01:03:51,560 "," 01:03:52,561"
I guess they're my mess.,"01:03:53,320 "," 01:03:54,765"
You need to be sure,"01:03:56,320 "," 01:03:57,924"
"that this team is really a team,","01:03:58,360 "," 01:04:01,045"
and that they have your back.,"01:04:01,160 "," 01:04:02,844"
Things are changing for us.,"01:04:06,200 "," 01:04:08,771"
"In a few months' time,","01:04:08,880 "," 01:04:11,281"
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.,"01:04:11,440 "," 01:04:14,205"
I need...,"01:04:14,320 "," 01:04:15,606"
Just be sure.,"01:04:18,800 "," 01:04:20,609"
"Yes, ma'am.","01:04:21,440 "," 01:04:22,930"
I can feel the difference.,"01:04:32,160 "," 01:04:34,003"
"Scream, and your entire staff dies.","01:04:46,960 "," 01:04:49,645"
"I could've killed you, Helen,the night we met.","01:04:51,560 "," 01:04:53,801"
I didn't.,"01:04:53,960 "," 01:04:55,007"
Do you expect a thankyou note?,"01:04:55,160 "," 01:04:56,650"
I expect you to know why.,"01:04:56,800 "," 01:04:58,484"
The Cradle.,"01:04:59,920 "," 01:05:01,206"
"This is the next thing, Tony.","01:05:01,280 "," 01:05:03,203"
This is the next me.,"01:05:03,360 "," 01:05:06,330"
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.,"01:05:06,720 "," 01:05:09,291"
It can't build a living body.,"01:05:09,400 "," 01:05:11,050"
It can. You can.,"01:05:11,160 "," 01:05:12,241"
You lack the materials.,"01:05:12,720 "," 01:05:14,006"
"You're a brilliant woman, Helen.","01:05:16,440 "," 01:05:17,805"
But we all have room to improve.,"01:05:21,080 "," 01:05:24,163"
I didn't realise you were waiting.,"01:05:45,960 "," 01:05:48,361"
"I would've joined you,but it didn't seem like the right time.","01:05:48,480 "," 01:05:52,883"
They used up all the hot water.,"01:05:53,840 "," 01:05:55,922"
I should've joined you.,"01:05:56,760 "," 01:05:58,205"
Missed our window.,"01:05:58,360 "," 01:06:00,010"
Did we?,"01:06:00,800 "," 01:06:02,040"
The world just saw the Hulk.,"01:06:05,600 "," 01:06:06,726"
"The real Hulk, for the first time.","01:06:09,400 "," 01:06:11,323"
 You know I have to leave. You assume that I have to stay?,"01:06:14,560 "," 01:06:17,211"
I had this dream.,"01:06:19,280 "," 01:06:21,931"
"The kind that seems normal at the time,","01:06:22,280 "," 01:06:24,248"
but when you wake...,"01:06:25,480 "," 01:06:26,720"
What did you dream?,"01:06:26,920 "," 01:06:28,251"
That I was an Avenger.,"01:06:29,280 "," 01:06:31,089"
That I was anything morethan the assassin they made me.,"01:06:33,120 "," 01:06:36,927"
I think you're being hard on yourself.,"01:06:38,400 "," 01:06:40,482"
Here I was hoping that was your job.,"01:06:42,600 "," 01:06:45,080"
What are you doing?,"01:06:48,040 "," 01:06:49,610"
I'm running with it.,"01:06:51,240 "," 01:06:53,049"
With you.,"01:06:54,360 "," 01:06:55,964"
"If running is the plan,","01:06:56,720 "," 01:06:59,041"
as far as you want.,"01:07:00,160 "," 01:07:01,924"
Are you out of your mind?,"01:07:03,800 "," 01:07:05,564"
I want you to understand that...,"01:07:10,920 "," 01:07:12,331"
"Natasha,","01:07:12,440 "," 01:07:13,851"
where can I go?,"01:07:14,960 "," 01:07:16,405"
Where in the world am I not a threat?,"01:07:17,480 "," 01:07:19,801"
 You're not a threat to me. Are you sure?,"01:07:19,920 "," 01:07:22,241"
Even if I didn't just...,"01:07:23,160 "," 01:07:24,969"
There's no future with me.,"01:07:26,600 "," 01:07:27,965"
I can't ever...,"01:07:29,640 "," 01:07:30,641"
I can't have this.,"01:07:30,880 "," 01:07:33,121"
Kids.,"01:07:33,840 "," 01:07:34,966"
Do the math. I physically can't.,"01:07:35,440 "," 01:07:38,011"
Neither can I.,"01:07:39,760 "," 01:07:41,205"
In the Red Room where I was trained...,"01:07:45,880 "," 01:07:49,407"
"Where I was raised,","01:07:49,880 "," 01:07:52,360"
they have a graduation ceremony.,"01:07:53,320 "," 01:07:55,971"
They sterilise you.,"01:07:57,600 "," 01:07:59,409"
It's efficient.,"01:08:02,640 "," 01:08:04,051"
One less thing to worry about.,"01:08:06,960 "," 01:08:08,325"
The one thingthat might matter more than a mission.,"01:08:10,440 "," 01:08:13,808"
Makes everything easier.,"01:08:16,160 "," 01:08:18,049"
Even killing.,"01:08:19,440 "," 01:08:20,680"
You still thinkyou're the only monster on the team?,"01:08:25,760 "," 01:08:28,843"
"So, we disappear?","01:08:35,040 "," 01:08:37,122"
Thor didn't saywhere he was going for answers?,"01:08:43,800 "," 01:08:45,640"
Sometimes my teammatesdon't tell me things.,"01:08:46,480 "," 01:08:49,006"
I was kind of hopingThor would be the exception.,"01:08:50,120 "," 01:08:52,168"
"Yeah, give him time.","01:08:52,280 "," 01:08:54,282"
We don't knowwhat the Maximoff kid showed him.,"01:08:54,440 "," 01:08:56,363"
Earth's mightiest heroes.,"01:08:58,560 "," 01:09:00,164"
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.,"01:09:00,320 "," 01:09:01,924"
Seems like you walked away all right.,"01:09:02,280 "," 01:09:03,760"
Is that a problem?,"01:09:06,200 "," 01:09:07,201"
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.,"01:09:07,560 "," 01:09:09,483"
Call me oldfashioned.,"01:09:10,680 "," 01:09:11,727"
"Well, let's just sayyou haven't seen it yet.","01:09:11,840 "," 01:09:14,411"
"You know Ultron is tryingto tear us apart, right?","01:09:14,720 "," 01:09:16,927"
"Well, I guess you'd know.","01:09:17,160 "," 01:09:19,401"
Whether you'd tell usis a bit of a question.,"01:09:19,520 "," 01:09:20,806"
Banner and I were doing research.,"01:09:20,960 "," 01:09:22,086"
 That would affect the team. That would end the team!,"01:09:22,240 "," 01:09:24,440"
Isn't that the mission?,"01:09:24,680 "," 01:09:25,761"
Isn't that the Why We Fight?,"01:09:25,960 "," 01:09:27,200"
So we can end the fight.So we get to go home!,"01:09:27,320 "," 01:09:29,561"
"Every time someone triesto win a war before it starts,","01:09:32,800 "," 01:09:35,167"
innocent people die.,"01:09:35,280 "," 01:09:36,850"
Every time.,"01:09:36,960 "," 01:09:37,961"
I'm sorry. Mr Stark...,"01:09:40,440 "," 01:09:42,841"
"Clint said you wouldn't mind,","01:09:43,720 "," 01:09:44,880"
but our tractor doesn't seemto want to start at all.,"01:09:44,920 "," 01:09:47,446"
" I thought maybe you might... Yeah, I'll give her a kick.","01:09:47,760 "," 01:09:50,120"
Don't take from my pile.,"01:09:53,560 "," 01:09:55,130"
"Hello, Deere.","01:10:05,360 "," 01:10:06,521"
Tell me everything.,"01:10:09,400 "," 01:10:10,811"
What ails you?,"01:10:12,040 "," 01:10:13,405"
Do me a favour.,"01:10:13,640 "," 01:10:14,641"
Try not to bring it to life.,"01:10:16,920 "," 01:10:18,809"
"Why, Ms Barton, you little minx.","01:10:18,960 "," 01:10:20,485"
"I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?","01:10:20,840 "," 01:10:23,366"
Was she ever not working for you?,"01:10:23,480 "," 01:10:24,800"
Artificial intelligence.,"01:10:24,880 "," 01:10:26,370"
You never even hesitated.,"01:10:27,400 "," 01:10:29,050"
"Look, it's been a really long day,","01:10:29,360 "," 01:10:30,720"
"like Eugene O'Neill long,","01:10:30,800 "," 01:10:32,404"
so how's aboutwe skip to the part where you're useful.,"01:10:32,520 "," 01:10:34,680"
Look me in the eye and tell meyou're going to shut him down.,"01:10:34,720 "," 01:10:37,320"
You're not the director of me.,"01:10:37,640 "," 01:10:39,051"
I'm not the director of anybody.,"01:10:39,160 "," 01:10:41,003"
I'm just an old man,"01:10:41,320 "," 01:10:42,924"
who cares very much about you.,"01:10:43,600 "," 01:10:45,170"
And I'm the manwho killed the Avengers.,"01:10:48,040 "," 01:10:49,849"
I saw it.,"01:10:51,680 "," 01:10:52,806"
I didn't tell the team. How could I?,"01:10:53,000 "," 01:10:54,570"
"I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.","01:10:55,840 "," 01:10:57,683"
"The whole world, too.","01:10:58,040 "," 01:10:59,565"
Because of me.,"01:11:00,000 "," 01:11:01,001"
I wasn't ready.,"01:11:02,240 "," 01:11:03,685"
I didn't do all I could.,"01:11:05,160 "," 01:11:06,571"
"Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.","01:11:07,600 "," 01:11:09,682"
" Playing on your fear. I wasn't tricked, I was shown.","01:11:10,320 "," 01:11:13,802"
"Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.","01:11:13,920 "," 01:11:16,207"
The end of the path I started us on.,"01:11:16,520 "," 01:11:18,682"
"You come up with some prettyimpressive inventions, Tony.","01:11:19,560 "," 01:11:21,800"
War isn't one of them.,"01:11:23,960 "," 01:11:25,371"
I watched my friends die.,"01:11:28,960 "," 01:11:30,405"
"You'd think that'd beas bad as it gets, right?","01:11:30,680 "," 01:11:32,682"
Nope.,"01:11:34,120 "," 01:11:35,565"
 It wasn't the worst part. The worst part,"01:11:36,560 "," 01:11:39,086"
is that you didn't.,"01:11:40,120 "," 01:11:41,406"
I'll see you tonight.,"01:11:48,120 "," 01:11:49,201"
I like the look.,"01:11:51,960 "," 01:11:53,246"
"If you're going for inconspicuous,though, near miss.","01:11:54,400 "," 01:11:56,926"
I need your help.,"01:11:57,280 "," 01:11:58,327"
It's nice to be needed.,"01:11:58,560 "," 01:11:59,561"
It's dangerous.,"01:11:59,960 "," 01:12:01,325"
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.,"01:12:01,960 "," 01:12:03,689"
Ultron took you folks out of playto buy himself time.,"01:12:06,600 "," 01:12:09,922"
My contacts all sayhe's building something.,"01:12:10,280 "," 01:12:13,250"
"The amount of vibraniumhe made off with,","01:12:13,360 "," 01:12:15,966"
I don't think it's just one thing.,"01:12:16,080 "," 01:12:17,570"
What about Ultron himself?,"01:12:17,680 "," 01:12:19,011"
He's easy to track. He's everywhere.,"01:12:19,120 "," 01:12:21,487"
The guy is multiplying fasterthan a Catholic rabbit.,"01:12:21,920 "," 01:12:24,287"
"It still doesn't help us get an angleon any of his plans, though.","01:12:24,960 "," 01:12:27,770"
Is he still going after launch codes?,"01:12:28,000 "," 01:12:29,081"
"Yes, he is.","01:12:29,360 "," 01:12:30,725"
But he's not making any headway.,"01:12:30,840 "," 01:12:32,330"
I cracked the Pentagon's firewallin high school on a dare.,"01:12:32,440 "," 01:12:34,522"
"Well, I contacted our friendsat the Nexus about that.","01:12:34,640 "," 01:12:37,246"
Nexus?,"01:12:37,320 "," 01:12:38,321"
It's the world Internet hub in Oslo.,"01:12:38,440 "," 01:12:40,090"
Every byte of data flows through there.,"01:12:40,520 "," 01:12:42,284"
Fastest access on Earth.,"01:12:42,520 "," 01:12:43,567"
"So, what did they say?","01:12:43,720 "," 01:12:44,767"
He's fixated on the missiles.,"01:12:45,000 "," 01:12:46,764"
But the codesare constantly being changed.,"01:12:47,000 "," 01:12:48,680"
By whom?,"01:12:49,160 "," 01:12:50,161"
Parties unknown.,"01:12:51,400 "," 01:12:52,606"
Do we have an ally?,"01:12:52,800 "," 01:12:53,926"
Ultron's got an enemy.That's not the same thing.,"01:12:54,040 "," 01:12:56,361"
"Still, I'd pay folding moneyto know who it is.","01:12:56,720 "," 01:12:58,563"

"Our ally, the guy protectingthe military's nuclear codes,","01:27:44,160 "," 01:27:48,210"
I found him.,"01:27:50,160 "," 01:27:51,161"
"Hello, Dr Banner.","01:27:51,240 "," 01:27:52,366"
Ultron didn't go after Jarvisbecause he was angry.,"01:27:53,240 "," 01:27:55,481"
He attacked him because he wasscared of what he can do.,"01:27:56,080 "," 01:27:59,687"
So Jarvis went underground.,"01:28:00,840 "," 01:28:02,490"
"Scattered, dumped his memory.","01:28:02,600 "," 01:28:04,090"
But not his protocols.,"01:28:04,680 "," 01:28:06,170"
He didn't even know he was in thereuntil I pieced him together.,"01:28:06,600 "," 01:28:10,047"
"So, you want me to help youput Jarvis into this thing?","01:28:12,880 "," 01:28:17,681"
No! Of course not.,"01:28:17,800 "," 01:28:19,564"
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.,"01:28:19,720 "," 01:28:21,404"
"We're out of my field, here.","01:28:23,800 "," 01:28:25,450"
You know bioorganicsbetter than anyone.,"01:28:25,560 "," 01:28:27,562"
And you just assumethat Jarvis's operational matrix,"01:28:27,880 "," 01:28:30,770"
can beat Ultron's?,"01:28:30,880 "," 01:28:32,325"
Jarvis has been beating him from insidewithout knowing it.,"01:28:32,440 "," 01:28:35,728"
This is the opportunity.,"01:28:35,880 "," 01:28:36,881"
We can create Ultron's perfect self,"01:28:36,960 "," 01:28:38,724"
without the homicidal glitcheshe thinks are his winning personality.,"01:28:38,880 "," 01:28:42,362"
 We have to. I believe it's worth a go.,"01:28:42,480 "," 01:28:44,562"
I'm in a loop!,"01:28:47,160 "," 01:28:48,241"
I'm caught in a time loop.This is exactly where it all went wrong.,"01:28:48,400 "," 01:28:51,370"
I know. I know. I knowwhat everyone's gonna say.,"01:28:51,480 "," 01:28:53,400"
But they're already saying it.,"01:28:53,480 "," 01:28:55,448"
We're mad scientists.,"01:28:56,000 "," 01:28:57,161"
"We're monsters, buddy.We've gotta own it.","01:28:57,920 "," 01:29:00,651"
Make a stand.,"01:29:01,640 "," 01:29:02,880"
It's not a loop.,"01:29:08,280 "," 01:29:09,770"
It's the end of the line.,"01:29:11,000 "," 01:29:12,764"
I wasn't sure you would wake up.,"01:29:33,280 "," 01:29:35,408"
I hoped you would.I wanted to show you.,"01:29:35,520 "," 01:29:38,967"
I don't have anyone else.,"01:29:39,120 "," 01:29:40,804"
I think a lot about meteors.The purity in them.,"01:29:43,640 "," 01:29:47,247"
Boom! The end.,"01:29:47,400 "," 01:29:48,925"
Start again.,"01:29:49,400 "," 01:29:50,811"
The world made clean,"01:29:50,960 "," 01:29:52,928"
for the new man to rebuild.,"01:29:53,040 "," 01:29:55,361"
I was meant to be new.,"01:29:55,680 "," 01:29:57,808"
I was meant to be beautiful.,"01:29:58,680 "," 01:30:01,286"
The world would have looked to the sky,"01:30:01,840 "," 01:30:03,968"
"and seen hope,","01:30:04,080 "," 01:30:05,320"
seen mercy.,"01:30:05,680 "," 01:30:07,011"
"Instead, they'll look up in horror","01:30:07,800 "," 01:30:09,882"
because of you.,"01:30:10,000 "," 01:30:11,331"
You've wounded me.,"01:30:11,520 "," 01:30:13,329"
I give you full marks for that.,"01:30:14,000 "," 01:30:15,684"
"But, like the man said,what doesn't kill me...","01:30:16,320 "," 01:30:19,244"
...just makes me stronger.,"01:30:24,480 "," 01:30:25,811"
This framework is not compatible.,"01:31:05,880 "," 01:31:08,042"
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.,"01:31:08,200 "," 01:31:10,885"
You have got to upload that schematicin the next three minutes.,"01:31:11,000 "," 01:31:14,846"
 I'm gonna say this once. How about nonece?,"01:31:17,120 "," 01:31:19,043"
" Shut it down! Nope, not gonna happen.","01:31:19,240 "," 01:31:21,288"
You don't know what you're doing.,"01:31:21,400 "," 01:31:22,561"
And you do?,"01:31:22,720 "," 01:31:24,051"
She's not in your head?,"01:31:24,400 "," 01:31:25,401"
I know you're angry.,"01:31:25,560 "," 01:31:27,210"
We're way past that.,"01:31:27,320 "," 01:31:28,685"
I could choke the life out of youand never change a shade.,"01:31:28,800 "," 01:31:31,246"
"Banner, after everythingthat's happened...","01:31:31,480 "," 01:31:33,160"
It's nothing compared to what's coming!,"01:31:33,240 "," 01:31:34,605"
 You don't know what's in there. This isn't a game!,"01:31:34,720 "," 01:31:37,087"
"No, no. Go on.","01:31:40,400 "," 01:31:41,811"
You were saying?,"01:31:42,760 "," 01:31:44,683"
Pietro!,"01:31:50,920 "," 01:31:51,967"
What?,"01:31:52,520 "," 01:31:53,601"
You didn't see that coming?,"01:31:54,000 "," 01:31:55,570"
I'm rerouting the upload.,"01:31:57,760 "," 01:31:58,921"
"Go ahead, piss me off.","01:32:05,240 "," 01:32:07,004"
Wait!,"01:32:19,320 "," 01:32:20,446"
I am sorry. That was,"01:33:45,120 "," 01:33:47,361"
odd.,"01:33:48,360 "," 01:33:49,771"
Thank you.,"01:33:50,000 "," 01:33:51,240"
Thor.,"01:33:56,160 "," 01:33:57,207"

"A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,and at its centre is that.","01:34:01,560 "," 01:34:05,281"
What? The gem?,"01:34:06,240 "," 01:34:07,241"
It's the Mind Stone.It's one of the six Infinity Stones.,"01:34:07,400 "," 01:34:09,971"
"The greatest power in the universe,","01:34:10,120 "," 01:34:11,360"
unparalleled inits destructive capabilities.,"01:34:11,480 "," 01:34:13,642"
 Then why would you bring... Because Stark is right.,"01:34:13,760 "," 01:34:15,728"
It's definitely the end times.,"01:34:15,920 "," 01:34:18,366"
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.,"01:34:18,560 "," 01:34:19,721"
Not alone.,"01:34:19,880 "," 01:34:21,120"
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?,"01:34:21,520 "," 01:34:23,443"
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix,"01:34:23,560 "," 01:34:26,245"
to create something new.,"01:34:26,760 "," 01:34:28,524"
I think I've had my fill of new.,"01:34:28,760 "," 01:34:30,444"
You think I'm a child of Ultron.,"01:34:30,600 "," 01:34:32,887"
You're not?,"01:34:33,240 "," 01:34:34,526"
I'm not Ultron.,"01:34:35,680 "," 01:34:37,250"
I am not Jarvis. I am...,"01:34:37,880 "," 01:34:40,087"
I am.,"01:34:42,200 "," 01:34:43,611"
I looked in your head,"01:34:45,520 "," 01:34:46,646"
and saw annihilation.,"01:34:47,360 "," 01:34:49,124"
Look again.,"01:34:49,280 "," 01:34:50,645"
Her seal of approval means jack to me.,"01:34:50,760 "," 01:34:52,280"

"Ultron himself, they all camefrom the Mind Stone.","01:34:54,920 "," 01:34:56,968"
And they're nothingcompared to what it can unleash.,"01:34:57,120 "," 01:34:59,282"
 But with it on our side... Is it?,"01:34:59,440 "," 01:35:00,965"
Are you?,"01:35:02,400 "," 01:35:03,561"
On our side?,"01:35:04,440 "," 01:35:05,885"
I don't think it's that simple.,"01:35:07,760 "," 01:35:09,649"
"Well, it betterget real simple real soon.","01:35:09,800 "," 01:35:12,246"
I am on the side of life.,"01:35:13,400 "," 01:35:15,528"
Ultron isn't.,"01:35:15,760 "," 01:35:17,125"
He will end it all.,"01:35:17,720 "," 01:35:19,131"
What's he waiting for?,"01:35:19,280 "," 01:35:21,203"
 You. Where?,"01:35:21,360 "," 01:35:22,361"
Sokovia.,"01:35:22,800 "," 01:35:23,961"
"He's got Nat there, too.","01:35:24,080 "," 01:35:25,161"
"If we're wrong about you,","01:35:27,320 "," 01:35:28,970"
if you're the monsterthat Ultron made you to be...,"01:35:31,640 "," 01:35:33,640"
What will you do?,"01:35:34,160 "," 01:35:35,685"
I don't want to kill Ultron.,"01:35:42,320 "," 01:35:44,402"
He's unique and he's in pain.,"01:35:44,800 "," 01:35:48,122"
But that pain will roll over the Earth.,"01:35:49,680 "," 01:35:52,251"
"So, he must be destroyed.","01:35:52,800 "," 01:35:55,087"
"Every form he's built,every trace of his presence on the net.","01:35:55,320 "," 01:35:58,244"
We have to act now.,"01:35:58,520 "," 01:36:00,170"
And not one of uscan do it without the others.,"01:36:00,600 "," 01:36:04,525"
Maybe I am a monster.,"01:36:06,520 "," 01:36:08,443"
I don't think I'd know if I were one.,"01:36:08,600 "," 01:36:10,841"
"I'm not what you are,","01:36:12,000 "," 01:36:13,604"
and not what you intended.,"01:36:14,280 "," 01:36:16,442"
"So, there may be no wayto make you trust me.","01:36:17,200 "," 01:36:19,680"
But we need to go.,"01:36:19,960 "," 01:36:21,371"
Right.,"01:36:36,160 "," 01:36:37,321"
Well done.,"01:36:37,960 "," 01:36:39,200"

"Good evening, boss.","01:37:00,200 "," 01:37:01,247"
No way we all get through this.,"01:37:06,400 "," 01:37:08,084"
"If even one tin soldieris left standing, we've lost.","01:37:08,200 "," 01:37:10,280"

Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.,"01:37:15,760 "," 01:37:17,250"
That's true. He hates you the most.,"01:37:17,360 "," 01:37:19,761"
Ultron knows we're coming.,"01:37:25,080 "," 01:37:27,242"
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.,"01:37:27,520 "," 01:37:29,727"
And that's what we signed up for.,"01:37:30,240 "," 01:37:31,969"
"But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.","01:37:32,240 "," 01:37:34,766"

is getting them out.,"01:37:38,080 "," 01:37:39,161"

And that's not gonna happen today.,"01:37:55,280 "," 01:37:56,640"
But we can do our best to protect them.,"01:37:58,280 "," 01:38:00,009"
And we can get the job done.,"01:38:00,720 "," 01:38:02,245"
"We find out what Ultron's been building,","01:38:05,640 "," 01:38:07,927"

Keep the fight between us.,"01:38:14,240 "," 01:38:16,163"
Ultron thinks we're monsters.,"01:38:22,880 "," 01:38:25,281"
That we're what's wrong with the world.,"01:38:25,800 "," 01:38:28,201"
This isn't just about beating him.,"01:38:28,320 "," 01:38:30,641"
It's about whether he's right.,"01:38:31,160 "," 01:38:33,208"

I don't suppose you founda key lying around somewhere.,"01:38:49,680 "," 01:38:51,840"
Yeah. I did.,"01:38:52,160 "," 01:38:54,288"

You're not gonna turn green?,"01:43:26,960 "," 01:43:28,080"
I've got a compelling reasonnot to lose my cool.,"01:43:28,280 "," 01:43:30,200"
I adore you.,"01:43:31,360 "," 01:43:32,646"
But I need the other guy.,"01:43:41,280 "," 01:43:43,203"
Let's finish the job.,"01:43:48,040 "," 01:43:49,804"

"Go, go, go!","01:45:50,040 "," 01:45:51,246"

and I have a bow and arrow.,"01:46:15,920 "," 01:46:17,126"
None of this makes sense.,"01:46:17,280 "," 01:46:18,361"

You're bothering me.,"01:48:13,600 "," 01:48:15,204"
"All right, we're all clear here.","01:48:50,600 "," 01:48:51,880"
We are not clear!,"01:48:51,960 "," 01:48:53,007"
We are very not clear!,"01:48:53,120 "," 01:48:54,531"

"Keep up, old man!","01:48:59,400 "," 01:49:01,482"
Nobody would know.,"01:49:03,240 "," 01:49:04,765"
Nobody.,"01:49:05,600 "," 01:49:06,647"
"The last I saw him,an Ultron was sitting on him.","01:49:08,600 "," 01:49:11,524"
"Yeah, he'll be missed,that quick little bastard.","01:49:11,640 "," 01:49:13,529"
I miss him already.,"01:49:13,600 "," 01:49:14,601"
Hold your fire!,"01:49:30,160 "," 01:49:31,321"
Romanoff!,"01:49:41,200 "," 01:49:42,247"
Thanks!,"01:49:42,760 "," 01:49:43,761"
The antigravsare rigged to flip.,"01:49:53,160 "," 01:49:54,764"
"Touch them, they'll gofull reverse thrust.","01:49:54,880 "," 01:49:57,042"
The city's not coming down slow.,"01:49:57,160 "," 01:49:58,605"
Spire is vibranium.,"01:49:58,720 "," 01:49:59,846"
If I get Thor to hit it...,"01:49:59,960 "," 01:50:01,086"
It will crack. That's not enough.,"01:50:01,360 "," 01:50:02,725"
The impact would still be devastating.,"01:50:02,840 "," 01:50:04,365"
Maybe if we can cap the other end.,"01:50:04,520 "," 01:50:05,880"
Keep the atomic action doubling back.,"01:50:06,040 "," 01:50:07,690"
That could vaporise the city.,"01:50:07,840 "," 01:50:09,205"
And everyone on it.,"01:50:10,200 "," 01:50:12,043"
The next waveis gonna hit any minute.,"01:50:17,880 "," 01:50:19,723"
" What do you got, Stark? Nothing great.","01:50:19,880 "," 01:50:21,848"
Maybe a way to blow up the city.,"01:50:22,640 "," 01:50:24,881"
"That'll keep itfrom impacting the surface,","01:50:25,000 "," 01:50:26,286"
if you guys can get clear.,"01:50:26,400 "," 01:50:27,447"
"I asked for a solution,not an escape plan.","01:50:27,720 "," 01:50:29,609"
Impact radiusis getting bigger every second.,"01:50:29,840 "," 01:50:32,730"
We're gonna have to make a choice.,"01:50:32,920 "," 01:50:34,285"
"Cap, these people are going nowhere.","01:50:35,040 "," 01:50:36,565"
 If Stark finds a way to blow this rock... Not till everyone's safe.,"01:50:37,400 "," 01:50:40,200"
Everyone up here versus everyonedown there? There's no math there.,"01:50:40,600 "," 01:50:43,604"
I'm not leaving this rockwith one civilian on it.,"01:50:43,840 "," 01:50:45,800"
I didn't say we should leave.,"01:50:45,840 "," 01:50:47,285"
There's worse ways to go.,"01:50:50,120 "," 01:50:51,929"
Where else am I gonna geta view like this?,"01:50:57,400 "," 01:50:59,846"

It's about to get better.,"01:51:03,440 "," 01:51:05,044"
"Nice, right?","01:51:29,160 "," 01:51:30,366"
Pulled her out of mothballswith a couple of old friends.,"01:51:30,480 "," 01:51:32,926"
"She's dusty, but she'll do.","01:51:33,080 "," 01:51:34,730"
"Fury, you son of a bitch.","01:51:35,080 "," 01:51:36,525"
Ooh! You kiss your motherwith that mouth?,"01:51:36,680 "," 01:51:38,967"
"Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.","01:51:39,080 "," 01:51:41,287"
Lifeboats secure to deploy.,"01:51:41,440 "," 01:51:42,965"
"Disengage in three, two...","01:51:43,080 "," 01:51:45,765"
Take them out.,"01:51:46,960 "," 01:51:47,961"
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?,"01:51:57,640 "," 01:51:59,165"
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.is supposed to be.,"01:51:59,280 "," 01:52:01,726"
This is not so bad.,"01:52:03,400 "," 01:52:04,811"
Let's load them up.,"01:52:08,080 "," 01:52:09,411"
"Sir, we have multiple bogiesconverging on our starboard flank.","01:52:14,800 "," 01:52:18,641"
Show 'em what we got.,"01:52:19,000 "," 01:52:20,206"
You're up.,"01:52:20,560 "," 01:52:21,561"
Yes!,"01:52:26,840 "," 01:52:27,841"
Now this is gonna be a good story.,"01:52:28,080 "," 01:52:29,844"
Yup. If you live to tell it.,"01:52:32,480 "," 01:52:34,562"
You think I can't hold my own?,"01:52:34,720 "," 01:52:36,722"
"We get through this, I'll hold your own.","01:52:36,840 "," 01:52:38,440"
You had to make it weird.,"01:52:38,520 "," 01:52:40,363"
I got about 50 to 100 morecoming in after this group.,"01:52:45,200 "," 01:52:48,170"
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.,"01:53:05,120 "," 01:53:06,531"
"Let's go, everyone!","01:53:06,880 "," 01:53:07,961"
Number six boat is topped and locked...,"01:53:10,480 "," 01:53:12,482"
Or stocked... Topped...,"01:53:12,600 "," 01:53:15,001"
It's full of people.,"01:53:15,520 "," 01:53:16,965"
Incoming!,"01:53:18,720 "," 01:53:19,801"
"Oh, God!","01:53:22,840 "," 01:53:23,887"
You thinkyou're saving anyone?,"01:53:34,400 "," 01:53:35,640"
I turn that key anddrop this rock a little early,"01:53:37,520 "," 01:53:39,522"
and it's still billions dead.,"01:53:39,680 "," 01:53:41,762"
Even you can't stop that.,"01:53:42,240 "," 01:53:43,401"

I am running out of things to say!Are you ready?,"01:53:48,520 "," 01:53:52,081"
It's terribly wellbalanced.,"01:53:59,760 "," 01:54:00,886"
"Well, if there's too much weight,you lose power on the swing, so...","01:54:01,240 "," 01:54:04,722"
I got it. Create a heat seal.,"01:54:05,680 "," 01:54:08,331"
I could...,"01:54:08,760 "," 01:54:09,807"
I could superchargethe spire from below.,"01:54:09,880 "," 01:54:12,281"
Running numbers.,"01:54:12,440 "," 01:54:13,487"
A heat seal could workwith enough power.,"01:54:23,600 "," 01:54:25,284"
" Thor, I got a plan. We're out of time.","01:54:25,760 "," 01:54:27,762"

"If Ultron gets a handon the core, we lose.","01:55:00,480 "," 01:55:02,642"
Is that the best you can do?,"01:55:07,240 "," 01:55:09,242"
You had to ask.,"01:55:19,120 "," 01:55:20,690"
This is the best I can do.,"01:55:20,800 "," 01:55:23,121"
This is exactly what I wanted.,"01:55:23,240 "," 01:55:24,890"

"You know, with the benefit of hindsight...","01:57:04,760 "," 01:57:07,161"
They'll try to leave the city.,"01:57:16,440 "," 01:57:17,441"

Put up some baffling.,"01:58:25,200 "," 01:58:26,361"
She can't hear the kids running around.What do you think?,"01:58:26,480 "," 01:58:28,761"
You guys always eatin the kitchen anyway.,"01:58:28,800 "," 01:58:29,881"

We don't have a lot of time.,"01:58:37,240 "," 01:58:38,360"
So get your ass on a boat.,"01:58:38,960 "," 01:58:40,928"

Come on. Time to go.,"02:00:02,880 "," 02:00:04,211"
You didn't see that coming?,"02:00:36,640 "," 02:00:38,688"
For God's sake.,"02:01:34,960 "," 02:01:36,724"

"If you stay here, you'll die.","02:02:29,760 "," 02:02:33,003"
I just did.,"02:02:34,600 "," 02:02:35,965"
Do you know how it felt?,"02:02:36,760 "," 02:02:38,524"
It felt like that.,"02:02:52,600 "," 02:02:54,967"
"Thor, on my mark.","02:03:29,960 "," 02:03:31,610"
Now!,"02:03:46,680 "," 02:03:47,681"
"Hey, big guy. We did it.","02:04:15,680 "," 02:04:18,126"
The job is finished.,"02:04:19,160 "," 02:04:20,844"
"Now I need you to turnthis bird around, okay?","02:04:21,040 "," 02:04:23,725"
We can't track you in stealth mode.,"02:04:28,040 "," 02:04:29,849"
So help me out. I need you...,"02:04:31,960 "," 02:04:34,088"
You're afraid.,"02:05:19,760 "," 02:05:20,761"
Of you?,"02:05:21,760 "," 02:05:22,841"
Of death.,"02:05:23,520 "," 02:05:24,681"
You're the last one.,"02:05:25,400 "," 02:05:27,209"
You were supposed to be the last.,"02:05:27,440 "," 02:05:29,886"
Stark asked for a saviour,"02:05:30,120 "," 02:05:32,407"
and settled for a slave.,"02:05:33,440 "," 02:05:35,124"
I suppose we are both disappointments.,"02:05:35,240 "," 02:05:37,641"
I suppose we are.,"02:05:40,120 "," 02:05:41,360"
Humans are odd.,"02:05:42,080 "," 02:05:43,241"
They think order and chaosare somehow opposites,"02:05:45,080 "," 02:05:48,721"
and try to control what won't be.,"02:05:50,480 "," 02:05:51,811"
But there is grace in their failings.,"02:05:53,520 "," 02:05:55,966"
I think you missed that.,"02:05:56,280 "," 02:05:58,203"
They're doomed.,"02:05:58,880 "," 02:05:59,961"
Yes.,"02:06:00,880 "," 02:06:01,927"
But a thing isn't beautifulbecause it lasts.,"02:06:06,160 "," 02:06:09,084"
It's a privilege to be among them.,"02:06:11,160 "," 02:06:13,162"
You're unbearably naive.,"02:06:13,400 "," 02:06:15,926"
Well...,"02:06:16,200 "," 02:06:17,406"
I was born yesterday.,"02:06:19,480 "," 02:06:21,528"

Fat.,"02:07:37,600 "," 02:07:38,601"
One of our tech boys flagged this.,"02:07:39,720 "," 02:07:41,080"
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.,"02:07:42,200 "," 02:07:44,362"
Could be the Quinjet.,"02:07:45,480 "," 02:07:47,005"
"But with Stark's stealth tech,we still can't track the damn thing.","02:07:47,360 "," 02:07:50,730"
Right.,"02:07:52,280 "," 02:07:53,645"
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.,"02:07:54,080 "," 02:07:56,321"
He'll send a postcard.,"02:07:57,600 "," 02:07:59,489"
Wish you were here.,"02:07:59,760 "," 02:08:01,489"
You sent me to recruit himway back when.,"02:08:03,440 "," 02:08:06,728"
Did you know thenwhat was gonna happen?,"02:08:08,560 "," 02:08:11,131"
You never know.,"02:08:13,320 "," 02:08:15,243"
"You hope for the best,then make do with what you get.","02:08:15,440 "," 02:08:18,967"
I got a great team.,"02:08:19,440 "," 02:08:20,930"
Nothing lasts forever.,"02:08:22,040 "," 02:08:24,008"

"No matter who wins or loses,trouble still comes around.","02:08:26,560 "," 02:08:29,928"
The rules have changed.,"02:08:33,800 "," 02:08:35,006"
We're dealing with something new.,"02:08:35,200 "," 02:08:36,804"
The Vision is artificial intelligence.,"02:08:36,960 "," 02:08:38,246"
" A machine. So, it doesn't count?","02:08:38,360 "," 02:08:40,283"
"No, it's not likea person lifting the hammer.","02:08:40,480 "," 02:08:42,289"
"Right, different rules for us.","02:08:42,560 "," 02:08:44,210"
 Nice guy. Artificial. Thank you.,"02:08:44,440 "," 02:08:45,487"
"He can wield the hammer,he can keep the Mind Stone.","02:08:45,680 "," 02:08:48,570"
It's safe with the Vision.,"02:08:49,480 "," 02:08:51,562"
"And these days, safe is in short supply.","02:08:51,800 "," 02:08:54,326"
But if you put the hammerin an elevator...,"02:08:56,360 "," 02:08:58,328"
 It would still go up. Elevator's not worthy.,"02:08:58,440 "," 02:09:00,320"
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.,"02:09:00,360 "," 02:09:02,169"

to show up in the last few years.,"02:09:08,320 "," 02:09:09,731"
It's not a coincidence.,"02:09:09,840 "," 02:09:11,410"
Someone has been playingan intricate game,"02:09:12,240 "," 02:09:14,004"
and has made pawns of us.,"02:09:14,160 "," 02:09:15,810"
And once all these piecesare in position...,"02:09:15,920 "," 02:09:17,809"
Triple Yahtzee.,"02:09:17,920 "," 02:09:19,331"

there's nothing that can't be explained.,"02:09:24,640 "," 02:09:27,007"
That man has no regardfor lawn maintenance.,"02:09:34,320 "," 02:09:36,846"
"I'm gonna miss him, though.And you're gonna miss me.","02:09:40,000 "," 02:09:42,606"

"I will miss you, Tony.","02:09:46,480 "," 02:09:48,130"
Yeah?,"02:09:48,360 "," 02:09:49,361"
"Well, it's time for me to tap out.","02:09:49,520 "," 02:09:51,966"
Maybe I should take a pageout of Barton's book.,"02:09:52,200 "," 02:09:54,362"
"Build Pepper a farm,hope nobody blows it up.","02:09:54,520 "," 02:09:57,444"

The guy who wanted all thatwent in the ice 75 years ago.,"02:10:05,760 "," 02:10:08,889"
I think someone else came out.,"02:10:10,400 "," 02:10:12,243"
You all right?,"02:10:16,200 "," 02:10:17,281"
I'm home.,"02:10:19,960 "," 02:10:21,405"
"You wanna keep staring at the wall,or do you wanna go to work?","02:10:29,320 "," 02:10:32,085"
"I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.","02:10:32,240 "," 02:10:33,571"
I thought you and Tony werestill gazing into each other's eyes.,"02:10:33,760 "," 02:10:36,764"
How do we look?,"02:10:36,840 "," 02:10:37,887"
"Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.","02:10:38,120 "," 02:10:40,407"
We got some hitters.,"02:10:40,560 "," 02:10:42,244"
They're good. They're not a team.,"02:10:42,400 "," 02:10:44,801"
Let's beat them into shape.,"02:10:44,960 "," 02:10:46,610"
Avengers...,"02:11:05,080 "," 02:11:06,605"
