I might not have believed itif she didn't tell me herself.,"00:50:51,717 "," 00:50:55,554"
What are you talking about?,"00:50:56,388 "," 00:50:58,014"

and they refused.,"00:51:34,718 "," 00:51:35,886"
They said I wasn't worthy.,"00:51:36,052 "," 00:51:38,263"
She would still be with us.,"00:51:40,056 "," 00:51:41,391"

She used to tell us storiesabout Ta Lo,"00:55:47,137 "," 00:55:48,555"
when we were kids.,"00:55:48,638 "," 00:55:49,639"
A village in another dimensionfull of magical creatures.,"00:55:50,682 "," 00:55:54,894"

he's gonna destroy everythingthat's left of our family.,"00:56:14,497 "," 00:56:16,916"
This family was destroyeda long time ago.,"00:56:19,210 "," 00:56:22,088"

Oh. Where's she going?,"00:57:23,441 "," 00:57:25,318"
Why are you down here?,"00:57:25,485 "," 00:57:26,653"
"Well, some time ago,","00:57:26,820 "," 00:57:28,780"
I was offeredthe role of a terrorist.,"00:57:28,863 "," 00:57:30,406"
"I know, facile, trite,I couldn't agree more.","00:57:30,615 "," 00:57:32,867"
"But times were lean,you know what I mean?","00:57:33,034 "," 00:57:34,953"
"Anyway, the producer told mehe worked for the BBC.","00:57:35,120 "," 00:57:37,872"
"But, ironic twist,","00:57:38,039 "," 00:57:39,499"
"it turns out he, in fact,was a terrorist,","00:57:39,582 "," 00:57:42,168"
"and I wasn't playinga character at all,","00:57:42,335 "," 00:57:43,837"
but what I now recognise to be,"00:57:44,003 "," 00:57:45,296"
a rather unflattering portraitof your father.,"00:57:45,380 "," 00:57:47,340"
We all got our just deserts.,"00:57:47,757 "," 00:57:49,509"
"The producergot blown up by Iron Man,","00:57:49,676 "," 00:57:51,553"
"and I served timein federal prison,","00:57:51,636 "," 00:57:53,304"
which turned outto be the best thing for me.,"00:57:53,471 "," 00:57:56,307"
"I got clean,I rediscovered my passion.","00:57:56,391 "," 00:57:58,810"
 Then my dad broke you out? Exactly.,"00:57:58,977 "," 00:58:01,563"
 To kill you. Exactly.,"00:58:01,729 "," 00:58:03,815"
But just as his men,"00:58:04,566 "," 00:58:06,901"
"were tying me upfor my execution,","00:58:06,985 "," 00:58:09,612"

What's what?,"00:58:34,053 "," 00:58:35,054"
 That! What is that? That! That! That!,"00:58:35,221 "," 00:58:37,015"
You can see Morris?,"00:58:39,350 "," 00:58:40,685"
Morris?,"00:58:40,852 "," 00:58:41,853"
"Oh, Morris!","00:58:41,936 "," 00:58:44,606"
They can see you! You're real!,"00:58:44,772 "," 00:58:47,108"
All this time I thoughtI was hallucinating him.,"00:58:47,275 "," 00:58:50,320"
"Oh, this is such fab news.","00:58:50,486 "," 00:58:51,988"
Where's his face?,"00:58:53,072 "," 00:58:54,073"
He's a bit sensitiveabout that.,"00:58:55,700 "," 00:58:57,368"
Oh. Really?,"00:58:58,494 "," 00:59:00,205"
Morris says he knowswho you are.,"00:59:01,831 "," 00:59:03,458"
It talks... It talks to you?,"00:59:04,167 "," 00:59:05,501"
"If he didn't talk to me,","00:59:05,585 "," 00:59:07,128"
I'd have gone mad yonks ago.,"00:59:07,212 "," 00:59:09,047"
How would he know me?,"00:59:10,423 "," 00:59:11,799"
He says he grew upwith your mum. In Ta Lo.,"00:59:11,966 "," 00:59:14,802"
"Apparently, your father pickedhim up in some magic forest","00:59:15,678 "," 00:59:18,765"
on one of his expeditionsto find the entrance.,"00:59:18,932 "," 00:59:21,643"
He wants you to take him home.,"00:59:25,313 "," 00:59:26,898"
"Believe me, buddy,I would if I knew how.","00:59:29,484 "," 00:59:31,527"
"According to my dad,","00:59:32,237 "," 00:59:33,238"
the path thereonly opens once a year.,"00:59:33,321 "," 00:59:35,073"

Morris says he can guide youthere right now.,"00:59:41,955 "," 00:59:44,540"
You can get through the maze,"00:59:44,707 "," 00:59:45,917"
without waitingfor the path to open.,"00:59:46,000 "," 00:59:47,585"
"But, and it's a big but,","00:59:47,752 "," 00:59:49,754"
it's very dangerous.,"00:59:49,921 "," 00:59:51,965"
How dangerous?,"00:59:52,131 "," 00:59:53,132"
No one's evermade it out alive.,"00:59:53,299 "," 00:59:55,218"
But Morris is 90% confident,"00:59:55,385 "," 00:59:58,179"

That's howI escaped last time.,"01:00:26,708 "," 01:00:28,459"

"After the film, I asked her,","01:02:46,472 "," 01:02:48,599"
How did they get thosemonkeys to do those things?,"01:02:48,766 "," 01:02:51,185"
"And she patted me on the headand she said,","01:02:51,352 "," 01:02:54,147"
"It's not real, pet.It's just acting.","01:02:54,313 "," 01:02:57,191"
That's when I knew.,"01:02:57,358 "," 01:02:59,068"
If they can teachthose monkeys,"01:03:00,153 "," 01:03:01,571"
"to act that brilliantly,","01:03:01,654 "," 01:03:03,573"
just imagine what I couldbring to the world.,"01:03:04,240 "," 01:03:07,493"
So you became an actor,"01:03:08,077 "," 01:03:09,203"
because you thoughtthe monkeys were actually...,"01:03:09,370 "," 01:03:11,289"
Riding horses? I did. Yes.,"01:03:11,456 "," 01:03:14,125"

they were simply actingas if they were riding horses.,"01:03:15,960 "," 01:03:19,046"

"You found your passionand went for it,","01:03:24,802 "," 01:03:28,264"
and eventually used it,"01:03:28,431 "," 01:03:29,515"
"to cripple the US government,but whatever.","01:03:29,599 "," 01:03:31,642"
