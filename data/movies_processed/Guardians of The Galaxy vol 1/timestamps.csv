You are the one here with nothing to show for it.,"00:32:44,800 "," 00:32:46,643"
Your sources say that she meantto betray us the whole time!,"00:32:46,720 "," 00:32:50,805"
Lower your tone!,"00:32:50,880 "," 00:32:52,166"
I may be your...,"00:32:52,360 "," 00:32:53,361"
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.,"00:33:01,560 "," 00:33:05,451"
"The only matter I do not take seriously, boy,","00:33:06,560 "," 00:33:10,281"
is you.,"00:33:10,680 "," 00:33:11,966"
Your politics bore me.,"00:33:12,680 "," 00:33:15,206"
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.,"00:33:15,360 "," 00:33:18,443"
"And, apparently, you alienatedmy favorite daughter, Gamora.","00:33:18,520 "," 00:33:23,242"
"I shall honor our agreement, Kree,","00:33:25,760 "," 00:33:28,809"
if you bring me the Orb.,"00:33:28,880 "," 00:33:30,689"
"But return to me again emptyhanded,","00:33:31,600 "," 00:33:34,080"
and I will bathe the starways in your blood.,"00:33:34,680 "," 00:33:37,604"
"Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.","00:33:40,920 "," 00:33:42,809"
This is one fight you won't win.,"00:33:45,120 "," 00:33:47,851"
Let's head to the Kyln.,"00:33:49,080 "," 00:33:50,764"
"If we're gonna get out of here,","00:33:59,280 "," 00:34:00,486"
we're gonna need to get into that watchtower.,"00:34:00,600 "," 00:34:02,329"
"And to do that, I'm gonna need a few things.","00:34:02,480 "," 00:34:04,164"
The guards wear security bands,"00:34:05,120 "," 00:34:06,804"
to control their ins and outs. I need one.,"00:34:06,960 "," 00:34:09,327"
Leave it to me.,"00:34:09,800 "," 00:34:11,165"
"That dude, there.I need his prosthetic leg.","00:34:11,360 "," 00:34:14,170"
His leg?Yeah.,"00:34:14,280 "," 00:34:15,930"
"God knows I don't need the rest of him.Look at him, he's useless.","00:34:16,080 "," 00:34:18,322"
All right.,"00:34:18,480 "," 00:34:19,641"
"And finally, on the wall back thereis a black panel. Blinky yellow light.","00:34:19,800 "," 00:34:24,044"
 Do you see it? Yeah.,"00:34:24,200 "," 00:34:26,202"
"There's a quarnyx battery behind it.Purplish box, green wires.","00:34:26,280 "," 00:34:30,410"
"To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.","00:34:30,480 "," 00:34:32,642"
How are we supposed to do that?,"00:34:32,720 "," 00:34:34,165"
"Well, supposably, these baldbodies find you attractive.","00:34:34,240 "," 00:34:36,527"
"So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.","00:34:36,600 "," 00:34:38,250"
You must be joking.,"00:34:38,320 "," 00:34:39,481"
"No, I really heard they find you attractive.","00:34:39,560 "," 00:34:41,369"
"Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,","00:34:41,440 "," 00:34:43,090"
and it's in the middle of the mostheavilyguarded part of the prison.,"00:34:43,160 "," 00:34:45,606"
It's impossible to get up there without being seen.,"00:34:45,680 "," 00:34:48,445"
"I got one plan,","00:34:48,520 "," 00:34:49,567"
"and that plan requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,","00:34:49,640 "," 00:34:51,768"
so figure it out!,"00:34:51,840 "," 00:34:52,921"
Oh!,"00:34:53,000 "," 00:34:54,126"
Can I get back to it? Thanks.,"00:34:54,360 "," 00:34:56,283"
"Now, this is important.","00:34:56,360 "," 00:34:58,283"
"Once the battery is removed,","00:34:58,360 "," 00:34:59,930"
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode.,"00:35:00,000 "," 00:35:02,446"
"Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,","00:35:02,520 "," 00:35:05,251"
so you definitely need to get that last.,"00:35:05,320 "," 00:35:08,210"
Or we could just get it first and improvise.,"00:35:13,880 "," 00:35:16,042"
 I'll get the armband. Leg.,"00:35:16,120 "," 00:35:18,202"
"Prisoner,","00:35:30,280 "," 00:35:31,281"
"drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell,","00:35:31,480 "," 00:35:34,245"
or we will open fire.,"00:35:34,440 "," 00:35:36,329"
I am,"00:35:42,360 "," 00:35:44,408"
Groot!,"00:35:44,560 "," 00:35:47,291"
Fire!,"00:35:47,440 "," 00:35:48,805"
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.,"00:36:01,400 "," 00:36:03,767"
You idiot!,"00:36:09,400 "," 00:36:10,765"
How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?,"00:36:10,840 "," 00:36:13,605"
The animal is in control.,"00:36:19,800 "," 00:36:21,325"
Fire on my command!,"00:36:21,560 "," 00:36:23,528"
Creepy little beast!,"00:36:42,960 "," 00:36:44,325"
"Oh, yeah.","00:36:50,880 "," 00:36:53,963"
You need my what?,"00:37:05,920 "," 00:37:07,729"
 I'll need this. Good luck.,"00:37:23,880 "," 00:37:25,405"
It's internally wired.,"00:37:25,560 "," 00:37:26,971"
I'll figure something out.,"00:37:27,120 "," 00:37:28,770"
Drop the leg!,"00:37:32,280 "," 00:37:33,884"
Drop the leg and move back to your cell!,"00:37:33,960 "," 00:37:36,566"
Rocket!,"00:37:51,480 "," 00:37:52,811"
Move to the watchtower!,"00:37:55,600 "," 00:37:58,001"
You!,"00:38:28,960 "," 00:38:30,007"
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!,"00:38:31,000 "," 00:38:32,604"
"It was one time, man.","00:38:34,040 "," 00:38:36,122"
We need all available guards in full combat gear...,"00:38:37,880 "," 00:38:40,451"
Whoa!,"00:38:55,800 "," 00:38:56,926"
"Spare me your foul gaze, woman.","00:39:02,840 "," 00:39:04,330"
Why is this one here?,"00:39:05,440 "," 00:39:06,487"
We promised him he could stayby your side until he kills your boss.,"00:39:07,040 "," 00:39:09,520"
"I always keep my promises,","00:39:09,680 "," 00:39:10,920"
when they're to musclebound whackjobs,"00:39:11,000 "," 00:39:12,650"
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.,"00:39:12,720 "," 00:39:14,134"
"Oh, I was just kidding about the leg.","00:39:14,760 "," 00:39:16,410"
I just need these two things.,"00:39:16,480 "," 00:39:17,606"
" What? No, I thought it'd be funny.","00:39:17,680 "," 00:39:19,409"
Was it funny?,"00:39:19,480 "," 00:39:20,561"
"Oh, wait, what did he look like hopping around?","00:39:20,720 "," 00:39:22,404"
"I had to transfer him 30,000 units!","00:39:22,480 "," 00:39:24,448"
How are we going to leave?,"00:39:27,320 "," 00:39:28,446"
"Well, he's got a plan.","00:39:30,520 "," 00:39:32,045"
Right? Or is thatanother thing you made up?,"00:39:32,200 "," 00:39:33,884"
I have a plan! I have a plan!,"00:39:33,960 "," 00:39:35,485"
Cease your yammering,"00:39:35,680 "," 00:39:37,250"
and relieve us from this irksome confinement.,"00:39:37,400 "," 00:39:38,970"
"Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus","00:39:39,120 "," 00:39:40,485"
on that one.,"00:39:40,640 "," 00:39:42,404"
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.,"00:39:42,480 "," 00:39:44,960"
"It's just a metaphor, dude.","00:39:45,760 "," 00:39:46,807"
His people are completely literal.Metaphors are gonna go over his head.,"00:39:46,960 "," 00:39:49,850"
Nothing goes over my head.,"00:39:49,920 "," 00:39:51,570"
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.,"00:39:51,720 "," 00:39:54,803"
I'm gonna die surrounded bythe biggest idiots in the galaxy.,"00:39:55,480 "," 00:39:59,326"
Those are some big guns.,"00:40:05,520 "," 00:40:06,851"
On my command!,"00:40:08,160 "," 00:40:09,321"
Number 1!,"00:40:10,240 "," 00:40:11,241"
"Rodent, we are ready for your plan.","00:40:13,128 "," 00:40:14,335"
Hold on!,"00:40:14,360 "," 00:40:16,124"
Number 2!,"00:40:17,160 "," 00:40:18,969"
I recognize this animal.,"00:40:19,840 "," 00:40:21,649"
We'd roast them over a flame pit as children.,"00:40:21,720 "," 00:40:23,961"
Their flesh was quite delicious.,"00:40:24,040 "," 00:40:25,246"
Not helping!,"00:40:25,440 "," 00:40:26,601"
Number 3!,"00:40:26,760 "," 00:40:27,761"
All fire on my command!,"00:40:33,920 "," 00:40:36,651"
3!,"00:40:37,080 "," 00:40:38,161"
2!,"00:40:38,640 "," 00:40:39,846"
1!,"00:40:40,280 "," 00:40:41,441"
"He turned off the artificial gravity,","00:40:55,800 "," 00:40:57,609"
everywhere but in here.,"00:40:57,760 "," 00:40:59,728"
I told you I had a plan.,"00:41:38,400 "," 00:41:40,323"
That was a pretty good plan.,"00:42:03,040 "," 00:42:04,280"
Huh?,"00:42:04,640 "," 00:42:05,721"
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.,"00:42:15,600 "," 00:42:16,886"
"It's the Milano, the orange and blue oneover in the corner.","00:42:17,240 "," 00:42:19,925"
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.,"00:42:20,000 "," 00:42:21,764"
That's rude! They folded yours.,"00:42:21,920 "," 00:42:23,922"
The Orb's there. Let's go.,"00:42:32,200 "," 00:42:34,123"
" Wait, wait, wait. What?","00:42:34,320 "," 00:42:36,891"
That bastard didn't put it back.,"00:42:36,960 "," 00:42:38,689"
 Put what back? Here.,"00:42:39,160 "," 00:42:41,686"
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.,"00:42:41,840 "," 00:42:43,569"
 How are you gonna possibly... Just keep the Milano close by.,"00:42:43,640 "," 00:42:46,246"
Go.,"00:42:46,320 "," 00:42:47,606"
Go!,"00:42:47,760 "," 00:42:49,046"
"Ah, my neck!","00:43:09,280 "," 00:43:11,169"
"Well, how's he gonna get to us?","00:43:15,840 "," 00:43:17,126"
He declined to share that information with me.,"00:43:17,600 "," 00:43:19,568"
"Well, screw this, then!","00:43:19,640 "," 00:43:20,641"
I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish.,"00:43:21,440 "," 00:43:23,568"
"You got the Orb, right?","00:43:23,640 "," 00:43:24,926"
Yes.,"00:43:25,120 "," 00:43:26,690"
"If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.","00:43:49,320 "," 00:43:52,051"
No!,"00:43:52,120 "," 00:43:53,121"
We're not leaving without the Orb.,"00:43:53,200 "," 00:43:55,202"
Behold.,"00:44:03,840 "," 00:44:05,171"
This one shows spirit.,"00:44:12,640 "," 00:44:14,768"
He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan.,"00:44:14,880 "," 00:44:17,724"
"Companion, what were you retrieving?","00:44:17,920 "," 00:44:20,321"
You're an imbecile.,"00:44:26,520 "," 00:44:28,124"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa.","00:44:37,480 "," 00:44:38,641"
"Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?","00:44:38,720 "," 00:44:40,131"
You can't take apart my ship without asking me!,"00:44:40,320 "," 00:44:42,846"
" See, what is this? Don't touch that!","00:44:43,000 "," 00:44:44,843"
It's a bomb.,"00:44:44,920 "," 00:44:45,921"
 A bomb? Yup.,"00:44:46,000 "," 00:44:47,001"
And you leave it lying around?,"00:44:47,200 "," 00:44:48,804"
I was gonna put it in a box.,"00:44:48,960 "," 00:44:50,530"
What's a box gonna do?,"00:44:50,680 "," 00:44:51,727"
 How about this one? No! Whoa. Hey!,"00:44:51,880 "," 00:44:54,042"
 Leave it alone. Why? What is it?,"00:44:54,200 "," 00:44:55,201"
 Shut up. Hey!,"00:44:55,280 "," 00:44:56,770"
What is that?,"00:44:58,080 "," 00:44:59,127"
That's for if things get really hardcore.,"00:44:59,280 "," 00:45:02,011"
Or if you wanna blow up moons.,"00:45:02,440 "," 00:45:03,726"
No one's blowing up moons.,"00:45:03,800 "," 00:45:05,290"
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.,"00:45:05,440 "," 00:45:07,522"
"So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.","00:45:07,720 "," 00:45:09,802"
We're heading in the right direction.For now.,"00:45:10,320 "," 00:45:13,130"
"If we're gonna work together,you might try trusting me a little bit.","00:45:13,200 "," 00:45:15,680"
And how much do you trust me?,"00:45:15,840 "," 00:45:17,285"
I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was.,"00:45:17,480 "," 00:45:20,450"
Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.,"00:45:21,360 "," 00:45:24,284"
I don't know what it is.,"00:45:24,440 "," 00:45:25,726"
"If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.","00:45:25,800 "," 00:45:28,121"
"Put it down, you fool.You'll destroy us all.","00:45:28,280 "," 00:45:30,203"
"Or just you, murderess!","00:45:30,320 "," 00:45:31,321"
"I let you live once, princess!","00:45:31,480 "," 00:45:33,084"
 I am not a princess! Hey!,"00:45:33,240 "," 00:45:35,288"
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!,"00:45:35,440 "," 00:45:39,001"
We're stuck together until we get the money.,"00:45:39,720 "," 00:45:43,247"
I have no interest in money.,"00:45:43,400 "," 00:45:45,528"
Great.,"00:45:45,720 "," 00:45:46,960"
That means more money for the 3 of us.,"00:45:48,240 "," 00:45:51,323"
Mmm?,"00:45:52,520 "," 00:45:53,567"
For the 4 of us.,"00:45:54,000 "," 00:45:55,729"
Partners.,"00:45:56,040 "," 00:45:57,201"
"We have an agreement,","00:45:57,280 "," 00:45:58,884"
but I would never be partners with the likes of you.,"00:45:58,960 "," 00:46:00,754"
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.,"00:46:01,400 "," 00:46:03,084"
"And Quill, your ship is filthy.","00:46:04,160 "," 00:46:07,448"
"Oh, she has no idea.","00:46:12,080 "," 00:46:13,605"
"If I had a black light,","00:46:14,200 "," 00:46:16,202"
the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.,"00:46:16,280 "," 00:46:18,760"
"You got issues, Quill.","00:46:19,400 "," 00:46:21,129"
I swear.I don't know where they went! I swear.,"00:46:28,880 "," 00:46:32,441"
"If he knew where they were headed,","00:46:33,480 "," 00:46:34,686"
he would have already told us.,"00:46:34,760 "," 00:46:35,921"
Yeah.,"00:46:36,000 "," 00:46:37,001"
"Ronan,","00:46:37,560 "," 00:46:38,561"
the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.,"00:46:38,720 "," 00:46:41,803"
"Well, then,","00:46:41,880 "," 00:46:42,881"
send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant.,"00:46:43,040 "," 00:46:46,249"
"Find the Orb. Any means, any price.","00:46:46,400 "," 00:46:49,802"
And this place?,"00:46:49,960 "," 00:46:51,371"
The Nova can't know what we're after.,"00:46:51,520 "," 00:46:52,965"
Cleanse it!,"00:46:54,520 "," 00:46:56,409"
Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one?,"00:46:59,280 "," 00:47:01,282"
I like to stick 'em all in a row on my control console.,"00:47:01,800 "," 00:47:05,441"
I can't tell if you're joking or not.,"00:47:05,920 "," 00:47:07,922"

There's a chance they can contain it.,"00:59:59,320 "," 01:00:00,731"

"Nebula, please.","01:05:00,640 "," 01:05:01,846"

I saw you out there.,"01:08:17,480 "," 01:08:19,528"
I don't know what came over me.,"01:08:20,920 "," 01:08:23,400"
But I couldn't let you die.,"01:08:24,360 "," 01:08:26,203"
I found something inside of myself.,"01:08:29,040 "," 01:08:31,441"
Something,"01:08:32,480 "," 01:08:34,050"
incredibly heroic.,"01:08:34,200 "," 01:08:36,168"
"I mean, not to brag,","01:08:37,920 "," 01:08:40,446"

"Welcome home, Peter.","01:08:51,040 "," 01:08:53,520"
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!,"01:09:16,400 "," 01:09:19,165"
Quill just got himself captured.,"01:09:20,480 "," 01:09:22,767"
None of this ever would have happenedif you didn't try to singlehandedly,"01:09:22,920 "," 01:09:27,209"
take on a frickin' army!,"01:09:27,360 "," 01:09:28,600"

"Oh, boohoohoo.My wife and child are dead.","01:09:55,080 "," 01:09:59,449"

Everybody's got dead people.,"01:10:03,360 "," 01:10:05,249"

dead along the way!,"01:10:07,760 "," 01:10:09,649"
"Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.","01:10:13,440 "," 01:10:16,125"
The only chance we got isto get to the other side of the universe,"01:10:16,280 "," 01:10:19,568"
"as fast as we can and maybe,","01:10:19,640 "," 01:10:21,529"
"just maybe, we'll be able to live full livesbefore that whackjob ever gets there.","01:10:21,680 "," 01:10:26,322"
I am Groot.,"01:10:28,800 "," 01:10:30,165"

I am Groot.,"01:10:32,760 "," 01:10:35,525"
"I know they're the only friends that we ever had,","01:10:35,680 "," 01:10:38,365"
but there's an army of Ravagers around them.,"01:10:38,440 "," 01:10:41,171"
And there's only two of us!,"01:10:41,320 "," 01:10:42,970"
3.,"01:10:44,000 "," 01:10:45,240"
Aw!,"01:10:51,840 "," 01:10:53,126"
You're making me,"01:10:54,320 "," 01:10:56,561"
beat... up,"01:10:56,720 "," 01:10:58,290"
grass!,"01:10:58,480 "," 01:10:59,481"
"The Orb is in my possession,","01:11:02,000 "," 01:11:03,729"
as I promised.,"01:11:04,840 "," 01:11:06,365"
Bring it to me.,"01:11:06,520 "," 01:11:08,045"
"Yes, that was our agreement.","01:11:08,240 "," 01:11:11,528"

and you will destroy Xandar for me.,"01:11:14,120 "," 01:11:17,647"
"However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,","01:11:17,800 "," 01:11:22,362"
I wonder what use I have for you.,"01:11:22,520 "," 01:11:24,522"
"Boy,","01:11:24,680 "," 01:11:26,205"
I would reconsider your current course.,"01:11:26,520 "," 01:11:28,966"
Master! You cannot!,"01:11:30,120 "," 01:11:32,361"
Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.,"01:11:32,520 "," 01:11:35,046"
Not anymore.,"01:11:35,680 "," 01:11:37,330"
You call me boy!,"01:12:00,160 "," 01:12:02,401"
"I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,","01:12:02,560 "," 01:12:07,122"
and burn it to its core!,"01:12:07,280 "," 01:12:10,807"
"Then, Thanos,","01:12:10,960 "," 01:12:12,928"
I am coming for you.,"01:12:13,080 "," 01:12:15,048"
"After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?","01:12:17,400 "," 01:12:20,324"
You dare to oppose me?,"01:12:20,800 "," 01:12:22,643"
You see what he has turned me into.,"01:12:22,800 "," 01:12:24,643"
"If you kill him, I will help youdestroy a thousand planets.","01:12:24,720 "," 01:12:28,964"
You betray me?,"01:12:29,760 "," 01:12:31,285"
Steal my money?,"01:12:32,200 "," 01:12:33,201"
Stop it! Leave him alone!,"01:12:33,320 "," 01:12:34,924"
"When I picked you up as a kid,","01:12:35,320 "," 01:12:37,402"
these boys wanted to eat you.,"01:12:37,560 "," 01:12:39,881"
They ain't never tasted Terran before.,"01:12:40,080 "," 01:12:42,481"
I saved your life!,"01:12:42,640 "," 01:12:44,369"
"Oh, will you shut up about that? God!","01:12:44,440 "," 01:12:46,602"
"20 years, you been throwing that in my face,","01:12:46,760 "," 01:12:49,081"
"like it's some great thing, not eating me.","01:12:49,160 "," 01:12:51,891"
Normal people don't even think about eating someone else!,"01:12:51,960 "," 01:12:55,521"
Much less that person having to be grateful for it!,"01:12:55,720 "," 01:12:58,166"
"You abducted me, man.","01:12:58,320 "," 01:12:59,446"
You stole me from my home and from my family.,"01:13:00,480 "," 01:13:02,721"
You don't give a damn about your Terra!,"01:13:02,880 "," 01:13:05,008"
You're scared,"01:13:05,520 "," 01:13:06,521"
because you're soft in here.,"01:13:06,680 "," 01:13:08,808"
"Here, right here!","01:13:08,880 "," 01:13:09,961"
Yondu!,"01:13:10,320 "," 01:13:11,321"
Listen to me.,"01:13:11,480 "," 01:13:12,720"
Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.,"01:13:12,800 "," 01:13:15,041"
"I know what he's got, girl.","01:13:15,160 "," 01:13:16,969"
Then you know we must get it back!,"01:13:17,160 "," 01:13:19,447"
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.,"01:13:19,600 "," 01:13:23,002"
We have to warn them.Billions of people will perish.,"01:13:23,160 "," 01:13:26,209"
"Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?","01:13:26,280 "," 01:13:28,931"
Sentiment?,"01:13:29,000 "," 01:13:30,001"
Eating away your brain like maggots!,"01:13:31,480 "," 01:13:33,323"
That's it.,"01:13:38,080 "," 01:13:39,491"
No!,"01:13:40,160 "," 01:13:41,207"
But a captain's gotta teach his menwhat happens to those what cross him.,"01:13:42,920 "," 01:13:46,447"
Captain's gotta teach stuff!,"01:13:46,600 "," 01:13:47,840"
"If you kill me now,","01:13:50,680 "," 01:13:52,921"
you are saying goodbye tothe biggest score you have ever seen.,"01:13:53,080 "," 01:13:57,210"
The Stone?,"01:14:02,360 "," 01:14:03,771"
I hope you got something better than that.,"01:14:04,520 "," 01:14:06,488"
Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.,"01:14:06,640 "," 01:14:09,291"
We got a ringer.,"01:14:10,480 "," 01:14:11,811"
Is that right?,"01:14:11,960 "," 01:14:13,371"
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan.,"01:14:14,520 "," 01:14:16,887"
"His ships,","01:14:17,040 "," 01:14:18,280"
his army.,"01:14:18,440 "," 01:14:20,010"
He's vulnerable.,"01:14:20,160 "," 01:14:22,003"
"Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh?","01:14:22,800 "," 01:14:24,131"
"Me and you, taking down a marksidebyside, like the old days.","01:14:24,200 "," 01:14:27,761"
Let him go!,"01:14:35,480 "," 01:14:36,561"
"You always did have a scrote, boy!","01:14:38,280 "," 01:14:40,806"
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.,"01:14:40,960 "," 01:14:43,691"
"Captain, the shot was nondamaging.","01:14:52,000 "," 01:14:53,968"
"Attention, idiots.","01:14:54,120 "," 01:14:56,327"
The lunatic on top of this craftis holding a Hadron Enforcer.,"01:14:58,400 "," 01:15:02,200"
It's a weapon of my own design.,"01:15:02,360 "," 01:15:04,089"
What the hell?,"01:15:04,240 "," 01:15:05,366"
"If you don't hand over our companions now,","01:15:05,840 "," 01:15:08,525"
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.,"01:15:08,720 "," 01:15:11,007"
A very big new one!,"01:15:11,160 "," 01:15:12,924"
 I ain't buyin' it. I'm giving you to the count of five.,"01:15:13,080 "," 01:15:15,924"
" 5, 4, 3... No! Wait, hold on!","01:15:16,480 "," 01:15:19,609"
"Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!","01:15:19,760 "," 01:15:21,524"
We figured it out! We're fine!,"01:15:21,680 "," 01:15:23,682"
"Oh, hey, Quill.What's going on?","01:15:23,840 "," 01:15:25,220"
You call that figured it out?,"01:15:26,920 "," 01:15:28,604"
We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.,"01:15:28,680 "," 01:15:31,001"
"Oh, you want to talk about senseless?","01:15:31,160 "," 01:15:32,605"
How about trying to save us by blowing us up?,"01:15:32,680 "," 01:15:35,001"
We were only gonna blow you upif they didn't turn you over!,"01:15:35,080 "," 01:15:37,924"
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over,"01:15:38,000 "," 01:15:39,809"
when you only gave them a count of five?,"01:15:39,960 "," 01:15:41,340"
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae,"01:15:41,640 "," 01:15:43,961"
of the plan.,"01:15:44,120 "," 01:15:45,121"
This is what we get for acting altruistically.,"01:15:45,200 "," 01:15:47,521"
 I am Groot. They are ungrateful.,"01:15:47,600 "," 01:15:49,682"
What's important now,"01:15:49,840 "," 01:15:50,966"
is we get the Ravagers' army,"01:15:51,120 "," 01:15:52,770"
to help us save Xandar.,"01:15:52,920 "," 01:15:54,126"
So we can give the Stone to Yondu,"01:15:54,200 "," 01:15:55,690"
who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?,"01:15:55,760 "," 01:15:57,364"
We'll figure that part out later.,"01:15:57,880 "," 01:15:59,086"
We have to stop Ronan.,"01:15:59,280 "," 01:16:00,964"
How?,"01:16:01,040 "," 01:16:02,485"
I have a plan.,"01:16:02,640 "," 01:16:03,721"
You've got a plan?,"01:16:03,800 "," 01:16:04,801"
Yes.,"01:16:05,320 "," 01:16:06,321"
"First of all, you're copying me from","01:16:06,773 "," 01:16:08,015"
" when I said I had a plan. No, I'm not.","01:16:08,040 "," 01:16:09,454"
People say that all the time.It's not that unique of a thing to say.,"01:16:09,600 "," 01:16:12,524"
"Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.","01:16:12,600 "," 01:16:14,250"
I have part of a plan!,"01:16:14,600 "," 01:16:17,331"
What percentage of a plan do you have?,"01:16:17,480 "," 01:16:19,005"
You don't get to ask questions,"01:16:19,160 "," 01:16:20,571"
after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.,"01:16:20,680 "," 01:16:22,129"
I just saved Quill.,"01:16:22,440 "," 01:16:24,090"
We've already established,"01:16:24,160 "," 01:16:25,161"
that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.,"01:16:25,240 "," 01:16:26,924"
 When did we establish it? Like 3 seconds ago!,"01:16:27,000 "," 01:16:29,162"
I wasn't listening.I was thinking of something else.,"01:16:29,320 "," 01:16:31,114"
She's right. You don't get an opinion.,"01:16:32,000 "," 01:16:33,311"
What percentage?,"01:16:33,920 "," 01:16:35,001"
I don't know. 12%.,"01:16:35,160 "," 01:16:36,525"
12%?,"01:16:36,600 "," 01:16:37,965"
That's a fake laugh.,"01:16:39,960 "," 01:16:41,086"
 It's real! Totally fake.,"01:16:41,280 "," 01:16:43,009"
"That is the most real, authentic,hysterical laugh of my entire life","01:16:43,080 "," 01:16:47,688"
because that is not a plan.,"01:16:47,840 "," 01:16:48,841"
It's barely a concept.,"01:16:49,040 "," 01:16:50,451"
You're taking their side?,"01:16:50,600 "," 01:16:51,601"
I am Groot.,"01:16:51,760 "," 01:16:52,966"
"So what, it's better than 11%?","01:16:53,120 "," 01:16:54,485"
What the hell does that have to do with anything?,"01:16:54,560 "," 01:16:56,085"
"Thank you, Groot. Thank you.","01:16:56,160 "," 01:16:58,367"
See? Groot's the only one of youwho has a clue.,"01:16:58,880 "," 01:17:02,327"
Guys.,"01:17:07,360 "," 01:17:08,361"
Come on.,"01:17:09,200 "," 01:17:10,281"
Yondu is gonna be here in 2 seconds.,"01:17:10,440 "," 01:17:12,488"
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.,"01:17:12,560 "," 01:17:15,040"
I need your help.,"01:17:16,440 "," 01:17:18,363"
I look around at us.,"01:17:20,040 "," 01:17:22,407"
You know what I see?,"01:17:22,880 "," 01:17:23,927"
Losers.,"01:17:24,880 "," 01:17:25,881"
"I mean, like,","01:17:28,560 "," 01:17:30,130"
folks who have lost stuff.,"01:17:30,280 "," 01:17:32,248"
"And we have. Man, we have. All of us.","01:17:32,320 "," 01:17:34,482"
"Our homes,","01:17:35,600 "," 01:17:36,931"
"our families,","01:17:37,640 "," 01:17:39,051"
normal lives.,"01:17:40,160 "," 01:17:42,083"
"And, usually, life takes morethan it gives. But not today.","01:17:42,240 "," 01:17:44,971"
"Today, it's given us something.","01:17:45,800 "," 01:17:47,325"
It has given us a chance.,"01:17:47,480 "," 01:17:49,050"
To do what?,"01:17:49,200 "," 01:17:50,565"
To give a shit.,"01:17:52,400 "," 01:17:53,765"
For once.,"01:17:54,520 "," 01:17:56,329"
Not run away.,"01:17:56,520 "," 01:17:58,522"
"I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch","01:18:01,360 "," 01:18:03,840"
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.,"01:18:03,920 "," 01:18:07,003"
"But, Quill, stopping Ronan,","01:18:08,120 "," 01:18:10,726"
it's impossible.,"01:18:11,800 "," 01:18:13,848"
You're asking us to die.,"01:18:14,360 "," 01:18:16,647"
"Yeah, I guess I am.","01:18:23,320 "," 01:18:25,209"
Quill.,"01:18:38,040 "," 01:18:39,166"
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.,"01:18:43,360 "," 01:18:46,682"
I will be grateful to die among my friends.,"01:18:50,720 "," 01:18:54,930"
"You are an honorable man, Quill.","01:18:59,240 "," 01:19:01,163"
I will fight beside you.,"01:19:02,880 "," 01:19:05,087"
"And in the end,","01:19:06,280 "," 01:19:07,805"
I will see my wife and daughter again.,"01:19:09,760 "," 01:19:11,808"
I am Groot.,"01:19:17,760 "," 01:19:20,923"
"Oh, what the hell.I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.","01:19:31,240 "," 01:19:34,483"
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?,"01:19:40,480 "," 01:19:42,721"
We're all standing up now.,"01:19:43,200 "," 01:19:45,362"
"Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.","01:19:45,520 "," 01:19:48,808"
The Stone reacts to anything organic.,"01:19:56,040 "," 01:19:57,565"
"The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.","01:19:57,720 "," 01:19:59,768"
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stoneto the planet's surface and zap.,"01:19:59,840 "," 01:20:03,003"
"All plants, animals,","01:20:03,160 "," 01:20:04,810"
 Nova Corps. Everything will die.,"01:20:04,960 "," 01:20:06,450"
So Ronan does not make the surface.,"01:20:07,080 "," 01:20:09,048"
Rocket will lead a teamto blow a hole,"01:20:12,000 "," 01:20:13,968"
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.,"01:20:14,160 "," 01:20:16,288"
"Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.","01:20:16,440 "," 01:20:20,525"
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?,"01:20:20,600 "," 01:20:23,410"
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.,"01:20:23,480 "," 01:20:26,324"
"Once they know we're on board,","01:20:32,440 "," 01:20:33,521"
Ronan will isolate himself behindimpenetrable security doors on deck.,"01:20:33,720 "," 01:20:37,122"
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.,"01:20:37,200 "," 01:20:39,646"
"We'll make it to the flight deck,","01:20:39,800 "," 01:20:41,529"
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.,"01:20:41,600 "," 01:20:44,604"
"Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.","01:20:47,160 "," 01:20:50,243"
Use these devices to contain it.,"01:20:50,760 "," 01:20:52,842"
"If you touch it,","01:20:53,280 "," 01:20:54,611"
it will kill you.,"01:20:55,360 "," 01:20:56,691"
I'll contactone of the Nova officers,"01:20:59,520 "," 01:21:01,443"
who arrested us.,"01:21:01,520 "," 01:21:02,760"
"Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.","01:21:02,840 "," 01:21:04,490"
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.,"01:21:06,080 "," 01:21:09,243"
That guy's eye.,"01:21:10,000 "," 01:21:11,206"
"No! No, we don't. No, we don't need","01:21:12,120 "," 01:21:14,646"
that guy's eye.,"01:21:14,800 "," 01:21:16,131"
"No, seriously, I need it!It's important to me.","01:21:17,240 "," 01:21:19,846"
"Ronan's fleet has been spotted,","01:21:24,520 "," 01:21:26,204"
and will arrive in Tminus,"01:21:26,280 "," 01:21:27,406"
15 minutes.,"01:21:27,560 "," 01:21:29,164"
"Remember, boy.","01:21:29,560 "," 01:21:31,050"
"At the end of all this,","01:21:31,480 "," 01:21:33,369"
I get the Stone.,"01:21:33,520 "," 01:21:34,806"
"You cross me, we kill you all.","01:21:34,960 "," 01:21:37,406"
"Let's go get 'em, boys!","01:22:00,040 "," 01:22:01,371"
This is a terrible plan.,"01:22:10,880 "," 01:22:12,120"
"Hey, you're the one who saidyou wanted to die among friends.","01:22:12,320 "," 01:22:14,402"
Nova Prime.,"01:22:19,480 "," 01:22:20,481"
I received a transmission,"01:22:22,040 "," 01:22:23,246"
from one of the Ravagers.,"01:22:23,400 "," 01:22:24,640"
He says Ronan's in possession ofsomething called an Infinity Stone,"01:22:25,200 "," 01:22:27,771"
and he's headed toward Xandar.,"01:22:27,960 "," 01:22:29,325"
Good God.,"01:22:29,400 "," 01:22:30,606"
It's a trick. He's a criminal.,"01:22:30,760 "," 01:22:32,683"
Did he say why we should believe him?,"01:22:32,880 "," 01:22:35,326"
He said his crew just escaped from prison,"01:22:35,400 "," 01:22:37,562"
so he'd have no other reasonto risk coming to Xandar to help.,"01:22:37,760 "," 01:22:40,730"
He says that he's an,"01:22:41,560 "," 01:22:42,721"
ahole.,"01:22:43,760 "," 01:22:44,807"
"But he's not,","01:22:45,160 "," 01:22:46,366"
"and I'm quoting him, here,","01:22:46,560 "," 01:22:48,289"
100% a dick.,"01:22:48,400 "," 01:22:50,607"
Do you believe him?,"01:22:50,760 "," 01:22:52,046"
"I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.","01:22:52,720 "," 01:22:55,803"
"I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?","01:22:55,880 "," 01:22:58,804"
Yeah.,"01:23:02,520 "," 01:23:03,521"
A fleet approaches.,"01:23:13,600 "," 01:23:15,090"
They appear to be Ravagers.,"01:23:15,520 "," 01:23:17,124"
Fire!,"01:23:28,200 "," 01:23:29,281"
Cover it down.,"01:23:40,640 "," 01:23:41,801"
Submerge!,"01:23:41,960 "," 01:23:43,883"
"Rocket, hurry!","01:23:56,840 "," 01:23:58,046"
"All pilots, dive!","01:24:04,560 "," 01:24:05,766"
They're beneath us!,"01:24:05,920 "," 01:24:07,081"
Evacuate the city.,"01:24:15,920 "," 01:24:17,331"
Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.,"01:24:17,480 "," 01:24:20,962"
"Forward thrust, now!","01:24:28,000 "," 01:24:29,001"
Come on!,"01:24:42,520 "," 01:24:43,521"
Quill! Yondu! Now!,"01:24:45,240 "," 01:24:46,844"
"AW, hell!","01:25:09,160 "," 01:25:10,650"
"I'm going down, Quill!","01:25:10,800 "," 01:25:12,245"
"No more games with me, boy!","01:25:12,400 "," 01:25:14,164"
I'll see you,"01:25:14,320 "," 01:25:15,367"
at the end of this!,"01:25:15,520 "," 01:25:17,249"
"There are too many of them, Rocket!","01:25:23,520 "," 01:25:24,965"
We'll never make it up there!,"01:25:25,720 "," 01:25:27,449"
Peter Quill.,"01:25:42,480 "," 01:25:43,606"
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.,"01:25:43,760 "," 01:25:46,161"
"For the record, I advised against trusting you here.","01:25:46,320 "," 01:25:49,608"
They got my dick message!,"01:25:49,760 "," 01:25:51,125"
Prove me wrong.,"01:25:51,560 "," 01:25:52,721"
Yes!,"01:26:00,200 "," 01:26:02,089"
Yes!,"01:26:23,280 "," 01:26:24,361"
We're just like Kevin Bacon.,"01:26:27,760 "," 01:26:29,569"
The starboard kern has been breached!,"01:26:33,680 "," 01:26:35,205"
We have been boarded.,"01:26:35,360 "," 01:26:36,691"
Continue our approach.,"01:26:36,760 "," 01:26:38,171"
But the Nova Corps have engaged.,"01:26:38,320 "," 01:26:39,606"
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.,"01:26:39,760 "," 01:26:42,411"
Seal security doors!,"01:26:42,520 "," 01:26:43,521"
Now!,"01:26:43,760 "," 01:26:44,807"
Get out of my way!,"01:26:46,520 "," 01:26:48,807"
"Oh, man.","01:27:00,040 "," 01:27:01,565"
"All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade.","01:27:01,720 "," 01:27:06,089"
The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.,"01:27:06,280 "," 01:27:10,126"
Locked in!,"01:27:22,640 "," 01:27:23,846"
Locked in.,"01:27:24,640 "," 01:27:25,846"
We're locked in.,"01:27:27,400 "," 01:27:28,401"
I can barely see.,"01:28:06,680 "," 01:28:08,887"
When did you learn to do that?,"01:28:35,240 "," 01:28:36,969"
Pretty sure the answer is,"01:28:37,520 "," 01:28:38,601"
I am Groot.,"01:28:38,760 "," 01:28:40,364"
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.,"01:28:41,520 "," 01:28:44,046"
I want you all to know that I am gratefulfor your acceptance after my blunders.,"01:28:47,280 "," 01:28:50,648"
It is pleasing to once again have,"01:28:51,200 "," 01:28:53,407"
friends.,"01:28:54,040 "," 01:28:55,041"
"You, Quill, are my friend.","01:28:56,120 "," 01:28:59,010"
Thanks.,"01:28:59,080 "," 01:29:00,286"
" This dumb tree, he is my friend. Mmm.","01:29:00,480 "," 01:29:03,211"
"And this green whore, she, too...","01:29:04,720 "," 01:29:05,926"
"Oh, you must stop!","01:29:06,040 "," 01:29:07,565"
"Gamora, look at what you have done.","01:29:10,440 "," 01:29:13,205"
You have always been weak.,"01:29:13,920 "," 01:29:15,888"
"You stupid, traitorous...","01:29:16,160 "," 01:29:18,288"
Nobody talks to my friends like that.,"01:29:23,440 "," 01:29:25,761"
Head to the flight deck.,"01:29:26,920 "," 01:29:28,001"
I'll shut down the power to the security doors.,"01:29:28,160 "," 01:29:30,811"
Yondu Udonta.,"01:29:38,800 "," 01:29:40,609"
Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps.,"01:29:40,760 "," 01:29:44,242"
"Enough nonsense, Ravager!","01:30:01,040 "," 01:30:02,565"
Time to die...,"01:30:02,720 "," 01:30:04,529"
"Nebula, please.","01:30:37,240 "," 01:30:38,287"
"Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,","01:30:52,800 "," 01:30:55,531"
enact immolation initiative.,"01:30:55,720 "," 01:30:57,768"
They're divebombing the city!,"01:31:01,280 "," 01:31:02,805"
"Denarian Saal, should we break formation?","01:31:02,880 "," 01:31:04,689"
No! Hold your positions.,"01:31:04,840 "," 01:31:06,490"
"Keep Ronan up there, Saal.","01:31:38,120 "," 01:31:39,531"
We'll take care of the people down here.,"01:31:39,720 "," 01:31:41,324"
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.,"01:31:41,400 "," 01:31:43,607"
StarLord.,"01:31:46,800 "," 01:31:48,040"
Finally.,"01:31:48,520 "," 01:31:49,521"
Ah!,"01:31:55,080 "," 01:31:56,286"
You thief!,"01:32:00,440 "," 01:32:01,487"
You will never make it to Ronan.,"01:32:13,360 "," 01:32:16,204"
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.,"01:32:21,960 "," 01:32:24,201"
Come on!,"01:32:32,840 "," 01:32:34,205"
Finger to the throat means death.,"01:33:17,040 "," 01:33:20,522"
Metaphor.,"01:33:26,360 "," 01:33:27,771"
"Yeah, sorta.","01:33:27,920 "," 01:33:29,206"
"Oh, no.","01:33:29,360 "," 01:33:30,521"
Xandar!,"01:33:58,520 "," 01:33:59,931"
You stand accused.,"01:34:00,600 "," 01:34:03,251"
Your wretched peace treaty will not,"01:34:04,040 "," 01:34:07,044"
save you now.,"01:34:07,240 "," 01:34:08,401"
It is the tinder on which you burn.,"01:34:08,880 "," 01:34:12,168"
Rocket!,"01:34:36,760 "," 01:34:37,761"
"Hold on, Saal, just...","01:34:37,920 "," 01:34:39,729"
"Quill, you gotta hurry.","01:35:06,440 "," 01:35:07,680"
"The city's been evacuated,","01:35:07,840 "," 01:35:09,490"
but we're getting our asses kicked down here.,"01:35:09,560 "," 01:35:12,166"
Gamora hasn't opened the door!,"01:35:12,240 "," 01:35:13,685"
Nebula!,"01:35:38,400 "," 01:35:39,401"
"Sister, help us fight Ronan.","01:35:41,000 "," 01:35:43,480"
You know he's crazy.,"01:35:43,640 "," 01:35:45,165"
I know you're both crazy.,"01:35:45,600 "," 01:35:47,648"
No!,"01:35:47,840 "," 01:35:49,001"

I do remember your family.,"01:37:06,000 "," 01:37:07,570"
Their screams were,"01:37:08,240 "," 01:37:09,969"
pitiful. I...,"01:37:10,120 "," 01:37:12,248"
"No, Groot!","01:39:09,360 "," 01:39:10,486"
You can't.,"01:39:11,080 "," 01:39:12,206"
You'll die.,"01:39:12,280 "," 01:39:13,770"
Why are you doing this?,"01:39:14,320 "," 01:39:16,163"
Why'?,"01:39:16,320 "," 01:39:17,810"
We,"01:39:24,400 "," 01:39:25,970"

Groot.,"01:39:28,040 "," 01:39:29,565"
I called him an idiot.,"01:40:33,960 "," 01:40:36,008"
You killed Groot!,"01:40:58,720 "," 01:41:00,643"

Your guardians of the galaxy.,"01:41:07,000 "," 01:41:10,482"
What fruit have they wrought?,"01:41:10,560 "," 01:41:13,040"
Only that my father and his father,"01:41:13,120 "," 01:41:17,250"
shall finally know vengeance.,"01:41:17,320 "," 01:41:20,881"
"People of Xandar,","01:41:21,040 "," 01:41:23,281"
the time has come,"01:41:23,920 "," 01:41:25,684"
to rejoice and renounce,"01:41:25,840 "," 01:41:28,650"
your paltry gods!,"01:41:28,800 "," 01:41:31,007"
Your salvation is at hand.,"01:41:31,840 "," 01:41:35,162"
Listen to these words.,"01:41:47,920 "," 01:41:49,445"
Now bring it down hard!,"01:41:58,520 "," 01:42:00,204"
What are you doing?,"01:42:03,600 "," 01:42:04,681"
"Danceoff, bro. Me and you.","01:42:05,200 "," 01:42:07,771"
Gamora.,"01:42:11,200 "," 01:42:12,611"
Subtle. Take it back.,"01:42:13,640 "," 01:42:15,688"
What are you doing?,"01:42:16,120 "," 01:42:18,361"
"I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.","01:42:18,680 "," 01:42:21,001"
No!,"01:42:37,240 "," 01:42:38,730"
Peter! Take my hand!,"01:43:12,720 "," 01:43:15,849"
"Take my hand, Peter.","01:43:21,280 "," 01:43:23,282"
Mom.,"01:43:24,200 "," 01:43:25,611"
Take my hand!,"01:43:26,120 "," 01:43:28,168"
You're mortal!,"01:44:22,600 "," 01:44:24,568"
How?,"01:44:24,720 "," 01:44:26,006"
"You said it yourself, bitch.","01:44:26,160 "," 01:44:28,401"
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.,"01:44:28,480 "," 01:44:30,847"
"Well, Well, Well.","01:45:00,720 "," 01:45:01,926"
Quite the light show.,"01:45:02,480 "," 01:45:03,561"
Ain't this sweet.,"01:45:05,840 "," 01:45:07,524"
But you got some business to attend to,"01:45:09,040 "," 01:45:11,566"
before all the nookienookie starts.,"01:45:11,720 "," 01:45:14,166"
"Peter, you can't. Peter.","01:45:15,840 "," 01:45:18,047"
"You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.","01:45:18,200 "," 01:45:20,248"
"I don't know who you're selling this to,","01:45:20,720 "," 01:45:22,324"
but the only way the universe can survive,"01:45:22,400 "," 01:45:24,323"
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.,"01:45:24,480 "," 01:45:26,164"
"I may be as pretty as an angel,","01:45:27,000 "," 01:45:29,162"
but I sure as hell ain't one.,"01:45:31,400 "," 01:45:33,289"
"Hand it over, son.","01:45:35,000 "," 01:45:36,490"
Yondu.,"01:45:53,360 "," 01:45:54,361"
"Do not open that Orb.You know that, right?","01:45:57,440 "," 01:46:00,728"
You've seen what it does to people.,"01:46:01,360 "," 01:46:03,806"
"Yeah, Quill turned out okay.","01:46:14,560 "," 01:46:16,801"
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad,"01:46:17,680 "," 01:46:20,286"
like we was hired to do.,"01:46:20,400 "," 01:46:21,401"
"Yeah, that guy was a jackass.","01:46:21,520 "," 01:46:24,251"
He is gonna be so pissed when herealizes I switched out the Orb on him.,"01:46:29,120 "," 01:46:32,681"
"He was gonna kill you, Peter.","01:46:35,440 "," 01:46:37,283"
"Oh, I know.","01:46:38,480 "," 01:46:40,164"
But he was about the only family I had.,"01:46:42,040 "," 01:46:43,644"
No.,"01:46:46,560 "," 01:46:47,607"
He wasn't.,"01:46:48,880 "," 01:46:50,086"
Why would youeven know this?,"01:47:38,320 "," 01:47:39,651"
"When we arrested you, we noticedan anomaly in your nervous system,","01:47:40,000 "," 01:47:42,765"
so we had it checked out.,"01:47:42,840 "," 01:47:44,205"
I'm not Terran?,"01:47:45,560 "," 01:47:47,164"
You are half Terran.,"01:47:47,320 "," 01:47:48,845"
"Your mother was of Earth.Your father, well,","01:47:49,000 "," 01:47:52,641"
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.,"01:47:52,800 "," 01:47:56,361"
That could be why you were able,"01:47:56,680 "," 01:47:57,841"
to hold the Stone for as long as you did.,"01:47:58,000 "," 01:48:00,241"
Your friends have arrived.,"01:48:00,720 "," 01:48:02,165"
"On behalf of the Nova Corps,","01:48:04,080 "," 01:48:06,321"

for your help in saving Xandar.,"01:48:10,160 "," 01:48:11,889"
"If you will follow Denarian Dey,","01:48:13,680 "," 01:48:16,411"
he has something to show you.,"01:48:16,560 "," 01:48:18,164"
"Thank you, Nova Prime.","01:48:18,320 "," 01:48:20,084"
Your wife and child shall rest wellknowing that you have avenged them.,"01:48:28,680 "," 01:48:33,163"
Yes.,"01:48:33,680 "," 01:48:34,841"
"Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.","01:48:35,000 "," 01:48:36,923"
It's really Thanos I need to kill.,"01:48:37,680 "," 01:48:39,842"
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.,"01:48:42,520 "," 01:48:45,285"
We salvaged as much as we could.,"01:48:45,880 "," 01:48:47,848"
Wow.,"01:48:49,160 "," 01:48:50,286"
I...,"01:48:50,960 "," 01:48:51,961"
Thank you.,"01:48:53,960 "," 01:48:55,086"
I have a family.,"01:48:56,600 "," 01:48:58,284"
They're alive because of you.,"01:48:58,800 "," 01:49:00,290"
Your criminal records have also been expunged.,"01:49:04,960 "," 01:49:07,327"
"However, I have to warn you againstbreaking any laws in the future.","01:49:07,480 "," 01:49:11,485"
Question.,"01:49:12,080 "," 01:49:13,081"
"What if I see something that I want to take,","01:49:13,240 "," 01:49:14,401"
and it belongs to someone else?,"01:49:14,480 "," 01:49:15,811"
You will be arrested.,"01:49:15,880 "," 01:49:17,166"
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?,"01:49:17,240 "," 01:49:19,481"
 It's still illegal. That doesn't follow.,"01:49:19,960 "," 01:49:21,962"
"No, I want it more, sir.Do you understand?","01:49:22,120 "," 01:49:23,569"
What are you laughing at?,"01:49:23,720 "," 01:49:24,926"
Why? I can't have a discussionwith this gentleman?,"01:49:25,120 "," 01:49:26,565"
What if someone does something irksome,"01:49:26,640 "," 01:49:28,483"
and I decide to remove his spine?,"01:49:28,640 "," 01:49:30,802"
That's...,"01:49:32,400 "," 01:49:33,481"
That's actually murder.,"01:49:34,600 "," 01:49:36,841"
It's one of the worst crimes of all.,"01:49:38,600 "," 01:49:41,171"
So... also illegal.,"01:49:41,320 "," 01:49:44,164"
Hmm.,"01:49:44,960 "," 01:49:46,007"
"They'll be fine, Dey.","01:49:47,760 "," 01:49:48,807"
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.,"01:49:49,520 "," 01:49:50,681"
You?,"01:49:50,840 "," 01:49:51,841"
Yeah. Me.,"01:49:55,280 "," 01:49:58,250"
"Peter,","01:50:17,240 "," 01:50:18,765"
I know these last few months have been hard for you.,"01:50:19,360 "," 01:50:22,728"
But I'm going to a better place.,"01:50:24,000 "," 01:50:26,571"
And I will be okay.,"01:50:26,760 "," 01:50:29,206"
And I will always be with you.,"01:50:29,360 "," 01:50:33,081"
You are the light of my life.,"01:50:34,800 "," 01:50:37,485"
My precious son.,"01:50:37,640 "," 01:50:39,881"
My little StarLord.,"01:50:40,840 "," 01:50:43,764"
"Love, Mom.","01:50:44,520 "," 01:50:46,488"
"So, what should we do next?","01:52:47,040 "," 01:52:48,690"
Something good?,"01:52:49,000 "," 01:52:50,001"
Something bad?,"01:52:51,040 "," 01:52:52,166"
A bit of both?,"01:52:52,680 "," 01:52:54,330"
"We'll follow your lead, StarLord.","01:52:55,920 "," 01:52:58,844"
Bit of both.,"01:53:01,120 "," 01:53:02,167"
What do you let it lick you like that for?,"02:00:26,480 "," 02:00:28,801"
Gross.,"02:00:30,160 "," 02:00:31,685"
Yeah!,"02:00:34,720 "," 02:00:36,210"
But it burns going down.,"02:00:36,320 "," 02:00:38,129"
