Speaker,Line
Grandpa,"Peter, your mama wants to speak with you. Come on, Pete. Take these fool things off."
Meredith Quill,"Why have you been fighting with the other boys again, baby. Peter."
Young Quill,They killed a little frog that ain’t done nothin’. Smushed it with a stick.
Meredith Quill,You’re so like your daddy. You even look like him. And he was an angel. Composed of pure light
Grandpa Mer,"You got a present there for Peter, don’t you."
Meredith Quill,Of course.
Grandpa,"There. I’ve got you covered, Pete."
Meredith Quill,"You open it up when I’m gone, okay. Your grandpa is gonna take such good care of you. At least until your daddy comes back to get you. Take my hand. Peter."
Grandpa,"Pete, come on."
Meredith Quill,Take my hand.
Young Quill,Mom. No. No. No. No. Mom. No.
Grandpa,Come with me.
Young Quill,No. No.
Grandpa,You’ve got to stay here. Please.
Young Quill,No…
Grandpa,Okay.
Young Quill,No. Mom.
Korath,Drop it.
Peter Quill,Uh… hey.
Korath,"Drop it, now."
Peter Quill,"Hey, cool, man. No problem. No problem at all."
Korath,How do you know about this.
Peter Quill,"I don’t even know what that is. I’m just a junker, man. I was just.just checking stuff out."
Korath,You don’t look like a junker. You’re wearing Ravager garb.
Peter Quill,"This is just an outfit, man. Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me."
Korath,What is your name.
Peter Quill,"My name is Peter Quill, okay. Dude, chill out."
Korath,Move.
Peter Quill,Why.
Korath,Ronan may have questions for you.
Peter Quill,"Hey, you know what. There’s another name you might know me by. Star-Lord."
Korath,Who.
Peter Quill,"Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw. Guys."
Korath,Move.
Peter Quill,"Ah, forget this."
Bereet,Peter. What happened.
Peter Quill,"Hey, uh…uh. I…"
Bereet,Bereet.
Peter Quill,"Bereet. Look, I’m gonna be totally honest with you. I forgot you were here."
News Reporter,Scattered riots broke out across the Kree Empire today protesting the recent peace treaty signed by the Kree Emperor and Xandar’s Nova Prime.
Bereet,"Peter, you have call."
Peter Quill,"No, wait, don’t."
Yondu Udonta,Quill.
Peter Quill,"Hey, Yondu."
Yondu Udonta,"I’m here on Morag. Ain’t no Orb, ain’t no you."
Peter Quill,"Well, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I’d save you the hassle."
Yondu Udonta,"Well, where are you at now, boy."
Peter Quill,"I feel really bad about this, but I’m not gonna tell you that."
Yondu Udonta,I slaved putting this deal together…
Peter Quill,Slaved. Making a few calls is slaved.
Yondu Udonta,And now you’re gonna rip me off.
Peter Quill,"I mean, really."
Yondu Udonta,We do not do that to each other. We’re Ravagers. We got a code.
Peter Quill,"Yeah, and that code is steal from everybody."
Yondu Udonta,When I picked you up on Terra…
Peter Quill,Picked me up.
Yondu Udonta,…these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
Peter Quill,Yeah.
Yondu Udonta,"They ain’t never tasted any Terran before. I stopped ‘em. You’re alive because of me. I will find you, I will… Put a bounty on him. Forty K. But I want him back alive."
Kraglin,"Yeah, Cap."
Horuz,Alive.
Yondu Udonta,That’s what I said.
Horuz,"I told you when you picked that kid up, you should have delivered him like we was hired to do. He was cargo. You have always been soft on him."
Yondu Udonta,"You’re the only one I’m being soft on. Now, don’t you worry about Mr Quill. As soon as we get him back here, I’m gonna kill him myself. What we do need to worry about, is who else out there wants that orb."
Ronan,"They call me terrorist, radical, zealot, because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree, and punish those who do not. Because I do not forgive your people for taking the life of my father, and his father, and his father before him. A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten."
Xandarian Prisoner,You can’t do this. Our government signed a peace treaty.
Ronan,My government knows no shame. You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.
Xandarian Prisoner,You will never rule Xandar.
Ronan,No. I will cure it.
Nebula,"Ronan, Korath has returned."
Korath,"Master, he is a thief, an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord. But we have discovered he has an agreement to retrieve the orb for an intermediary known as The Broker."
Ronan,"I promised Thanos I would retrieve the orb for him. Only then will he destroy Xandar for me. Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the orb."
Nebula,It will be my honor.
Gamora,"It will be your doom. If this happens again, you’ll be facing our father without his prize."
Nebula,I’m a daughter of Thanos. Just like you.
Gamora,But I know Xandar.
Nebula,Ronan has already decreed that I…
Ronan,Do not speak for me. You will not fail.
Gamora,Have I ever.
Rocket,"Xandarians. What a bunch of losers. All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to nothing at all. Pathetic. Look at this guy. Can you believe they call us criminals, when he’s assaulting us with that haircut. What is this thing. Look how it thinks it’s so cool. It’s not cool to get help. Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle. chatting up a pretty young woman] Look at Mr Smiles over here. Where’s your wife, old man. What a class-A prevert. Right, Groot. Groot. Don’t drink fountain water, you idiot. That’s disgusting."
Groot,Mmm.
Rocket,"Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it. Why are you lying. Whoop. Looks like we got one. Okay, humie, how bad does someone wanna find you. Forty thousand units. Groot, we’re gonna be rich."
The Broker,Mr Quill
Peter Quill,Broker. The orb. As commissioned.
The Broker,Where’s Yondu.
Peter Quill,"Wanted to be here, sends his love. And told me to tell you, that you got the best eyebrows in the business. What is it."
The Broker,"It’s my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs."
Peter Quill,"Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you."
The Broker,"An occupational hazard, I’m sure, in your line of work."
Peter Quill,"Some machine-headed freak, working for a dude named Ronan."
The Broker,"Ronan. I’m sorry, Mr Quill. I truly am. But I want no part of this transaction if Ronan is involved."
Peter Quill,"Woh. Woh, woh, woh. Who’s Ronan."
The Broker,"A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty, who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture, is wiped from existence."
Peter Quill,Woh. Come on.
The Broker,He’s someone whose bad side I’d rather not be on.
Peter Quill,What. What about my bad side.
The Broker,"Farewell, Mr Quill."
Peter Quill,"Hey, we had a deal, bro."
Gamora,What happened.
Peter Quill,"Uh.this guy just backed out of a deal on me. If theres one thing I hate, its a man without integrity. Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord."
Gamora,You have the bearing of a man of honor.
Peter Quill,"Well, you know, I wouldnt say that. People say it about me, all the time, but its not something I would ever say about myself."
Gamora,This wasnt the plan.
Rocket,Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag.
Rocket,"No. Not her, him. Learn genders, man. Biting. Thats not fair. Take it easy."
Gamora,Fool. You should have learned.
Peter Quill,I dont learn. One of my issues. What the.
Rocket,"Quit smiling, you idiot. Youre supposed to be a professional. You gotta be kidding me. Hey. I live for the simple things. Like how much this is gonna hurt. Yeah. Writhe, little man. Itll grow back, you Dast idiot. Quit whining."
Nova Arresting Pilot,"Subject 89P13, drop your weapon."
Rocket,"Oh, crap."
Nova Arresting Pilot,"By the authority of the Nova Corps, you are under arrest."
Corpsman Dey,Alright. Come on up.
Nova Arresting Pilot,.for endangerment to life and the destruction of property.
Corpsman Dey,Hey. If it isnt Star-Prince.
Peter Quill,Star-Lord.
Corpsman Dey,"Oh, sorry. Lord. I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft. Hes got a code name."
Peter Quill,"Come on, man. Its a.its an outlaw name."
Corpsman Dey,"Just relax, pal. Its cool to have a code name. Its not that weird."
Rocket,Fascists.
Nova Prime,Ronan is destroying Xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy. I should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the Kree.
Kree Ambassador,"We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime. What more do you want."
Nova Prime,"At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions. He is slaughtering children, families."
Kree Ambassador,"That is your business. Now, I have other matters to attend to."
Nova Prime,Prick.
Denarian Saal,"Well, some good news. Looks like we’ve apprehended one of Ronan’s compatriots."
Corpsman Dey,"Gamora. Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon. The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos. Recently, Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan, which leads us to believe that Thanos and Ronan are working together."
Corpsman Dey,Subject 89P13. Calls itself Rocket. The result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form.
Denarian Saal *referring to Groot*,What the hell.
Corpsman Dey,They call it Groot. A humanoid plant that’s been traveling recently as 89P13’s personal house plant slash muscle.
Corpsman Dey,"Peter Jason Quill, from Terra. Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers, led by Yondu Udonta."
Peter Quill,"Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know how this machine worked."
Denarian Saal,What a bunch of a-holes. Transport all four to the Kyln.
Rocket,"I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws, but these ones here, theyre corrupt and cruel. But, hey, thats not my problem. I aint gonna be here long. Ive escaped 22 prisons, this ones no different. Youre lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot would be collecting that bounty right now, and youd be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers."
Peter Quill,Ive had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years. I aint about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon.
Prison Guard,Hold.
Rocket,Whats a raccoon.
Peter Quill,"Whats a raccoon. Its what you are, stupid."
Rocket,"Aint no thing like me, cept me."
Peter Quill,"So, this orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe. What is it."
Groot,I am Groot.
Peter Quill,So what. Whats the Orb.
Gamora,I have no words for an honorless thief.
Rocket,"Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac. Yeah, I know who you are. Anyone whos anyone knows who you are."
Peter Quill,"Yeah, we know who you are. Who is she. Yeah, you said that."
Gamora,"I wasnt retrieving the orb for Ronan, I was betraying him. I had an agreement to sell it to a third party."
Groot,I am Groot.
Peter Quill,"Well, that’s just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told that. What is wrong with Giving Tree, here."
Rocket,"Well, he don’t know talking good like me and you. So his vocabulistics is limited to “I” and “am” and “Groot”. Exclusively in that order."
Peter Quill,"I tell you what, that’s gonna wear real thin, real fast."
Peter Quill,Hey. Put that away. Hey.
Peter Quill,"Listen to me you big blue bastard, take those headphones off, thats mine. Those belong to impound, that tape and that player is mine."
Peter Quill,"Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973, that song belongs to me."
Prisoner 1,- Murderer.
Prisoner 2,"Coming for you first, Gamora."
Prisoner 3,Youre dead.
Prisoner 4,Youre scum. Youre scum.
Rocket,"Its like I said, shes got a rep. A lot of prisoners here have lost their families to Ronan and his goons. Shell last a day, tops."
Prisoner 5,Murderer.
Peter Quill,"The guards will protect her, right."
Peter Quill,Theyre here to stop us from getting out. They dont care what we do to each other inside.
Gamora,"Whatever nightmares the future holds, are dreams compared to whats behind me."
Prisoner 6,"Check out the new meat. Im gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly, and go to town."
Rocket,"Lets make something clear. This one here is our booty. You wanna get to him, you go through us. Or, more accurately, we go through you."
Peter Quill,Im with them.
Prisoner 7,I hate you.
Prisoner 8,No cells gonna protect you for long.
Prisoner 9,Youre dead. Dead.
Prisoner 10,Take her down to the showers. Itll be easier to clean up the blood down there.
Rocket,"Quill, where you going. Quill. Quill."
Prisoner 5,"Gamora, consider this a death sentence for your crimes against the galaxy."
Drax,"You dare. You know who I am, yes."
Prisoner 5,Youre Drax. The Destroyer.
Rocket,Quill.
Drax,And you know why they call me this.
Prisoner 5,You slayed dozens of Ronans minions.
Drax,"Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette, and my daughter, Camaria. He slaughtered them where they stood. And he laughed."
Rocket,Quill.
Drax,Her life is not yours to take. He killed my family. I shall kill one of his in return.
Prisoner 5,"Of course, Drax. Here, I."
Rocket,Quill. What are you doing.
Gamora,Im no family to Ronan or Thanos. Im your only hope at stopping him.
Drax,"Woman, your words mean nothing to me."
Peter Quill,"Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey."
Rocket,Crap.
Peter Quill,"You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose, I dont think this is the best way to go about it."
Drax,Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill.
Peter Quill,"Well, I mean, shes hardly the first woman to try and do that to me. Look, this is from a smoking-hot Rajak girl. Stabbed me with a fork. Didnt like me skipping out on her at sunrise. I got, right here, a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax. She caught me with this skinny little Aaskavariian who worked in Nova Records. I was trying to get information. You ever see an Aaskavariian. They have tentacles, and needles for teeth. If you think Im seriously interested in that, then. You dont care. But heres the point. She betrayed Ronan. Hes coming back for her. And when he does, thats when you."
Drax,Why would I put my finger on his throat.
Peter Quill,"What. No, its a symbol. This is a symbol for you slicing his throat."
Drax,I would not slice his throat. I would cut his head clean off.
Peter Quill,"Its a general expression for you killing somebody. Youve heard of this. Youve seen this, right. You know what that is."
Prisoner 5,Yeah. Yeah.
Peter Quill,Everyone knows.
Prisoner 5,"No, no."
Peter Quill,"What Im saying is, you want to keep her alive. Dont do his work for him."
Drax,I like your knife. Im keeping it.
Prisoner 5,That was my favorite knife.
Peter Quill,Listen. I could care less whether you live or whether you die.
Gamora,Then why stop the big guy.
Peter Quill,Simple. You know where to sell my Orb.
Gamora,How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here.
Peter Quill,"My friend Rocket, here, has escaped 22 prisons."
Rocket,"Oh, were getting out. And then were headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty."
Peter Quill,How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb.
Gamora,Four billion units.
Rocket,What.
Peter Quill,Holy shit.
Gamora,"That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan. If you free us, Ill lead you to the buyer directly and Ill split the profit between the three of us."
Groot,I am Groot.
Rocket,"Four of us. Asleep for the danger, awake for the money, as per frickin usual."
The Other,"You have been betrayed, Ronan."
Ronan the Accuser,We know only that she has been captured. Gamora may yet recover the Orb.
The Other,No. Our sources within the Kyln say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb. Your partnership with Thanos is at risk.
The Other,Thanos requires your presence. NOW.
Ronan the Accuser,"With all due respect, Thanos, your daughter made this mess, and yet you summon me."
The Other,"I would lower my voice, Accuser."
Ronan the Accuser,"First, she lost a battle with some primitive."
The Other,Thanos put Gamora under your charge.
Ronan the Accuser,Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.
The Other,You are the one here with nothing to show for it.
Ronan the Accuser,Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time.
The Other,LOWER YOUR TONE. I MAY BE YOUR-
Ronan the Accuser,I only ask that you take this matter seriously.
Thanos,"The only matter I did not take seriously, boy."
Thanos,.is you.
Thanos,Your politics bore me.
Thanos,Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.
Thanos,"And, apparently.you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora."
Thanos,"I shall honor our agreement, Kree."
Thanos,If you bring me the Orb.
Thanos *off-screen*,But return to me again empty-handed.
Thanos,.and I will bathe the starways in your blood.
Nebula,"Thanks, dad.sounds fair."
Nebula,This is one fight you wont win.
Nebula,Lets head to the Klyn.
Rocket,"If were gonna get out of here, were gonna need to get into that watchtower. And to do that, Im gonna need a few things. The guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs. I need one."
Gamora,Leave it to me.
Rocket,"That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg."
Peter Quill,His leg.
Rocket,"Yeah. God knows I dont need the rest of him. Look at him, hes useless."
Peter Quill,All right.
Rocket,"And finally, on the wall back there is a black panel. Blinky yellow light. Do you see it."
Peter Quill,Yeah.
Rocket,"Theres a quarnyx battery behind it. Purplish box, green wires. To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it."
Gamora,How are we supposed to do that.
Rocket,"Well, supposably, these bald-bodies find you attractive. So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade."
Gamora,You must be joking.
Rocket,"No, I really heard they find you attractive."
Peter Quill,"Look, its 20 feet up in the air, and its in the middle of the most heavily-guarded part of the prison. Its impossible to get up there without being seen."
Rocket,"I got one plan, and that plan requires a frickin quarnyx battery, so figure it out. Can I get back to it. Thanks. Now, this is important. Once the battery is removed, everything is gonna slam into emergency mode. Once we have it, we gotta move quickly, so you definitely need to get that last. Or we could just get it first and improvise."
Gamora,Ill get the armband.
Peter Quill,Leg.
Guard 1,"Prisoner, drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell, or we will open fire."
Groot,I am Groot.
Guard 1,Fire.
Guard 1,All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.
Rocket,You idiot. How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff.
Guard 2,The animal is in control. Fire on my command.
Drax,Creepy little beast.
Rocket,"Oh, yeah."
Man,You need my what.
Gamora,Ill need this.
Guard 3,Good luck. Its internally wired.
Gamora,Ill figure something out.
Guard 4,Drop the leg. Drop the leg and move back to your cell.
Gamora,Rocket.
"Rocket, to Groot",Move to the watchtower.
Drax,You. Man who has lain with an Aaskavariian.
Peter Quill,"It was one time, man."
Guard 1,We need all available guards in full combat gear.
Drax,"Spare me your foul gaze, woman."
Gamora,Why is this one here.
Peter Quill,"We promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss. I always keep my promises, when theyre to muscle-bound whack-jobs who will kill me if I dont. Here you go."
Rocket,"Oh, I was just kidding about the leg. I just need these two things."
Peter Quill,What.
"Rocket, while giggling","No, I thought itd be funny. Was it funny. Wait, what did he look like hopping around."
Peter Quill,"I had to transfer him 30,000 units."
Drax,How are we going to leave.
Peter Quill,"Well, hes got a plan. Right. Or is that another thing you made up."
Rocket,I have a plan. I have a plan.
Drax,Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.
Peter Quill,"Yeah, Ill have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one."
Drax,Do not ever call me a thesaurus.
Peter Quill,"Its just a metaphor, dude."
Rocket,"His people are completely literal, metaphors are gonna go over his head."
Drax,Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.
Gamora,Im gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.
Peter Quill,Those are some big guns.
Head Riot Guard,On my command. Number one.
Gamora,"Rodent, we are ready for your plan."
Rocket,Hold on.
Head Riot Guard,Number two.
Drax,I recognize this animal. Wed roast them over a flame pit as children. Their flesh was quite delicious.
Rocket,Not helping.
Head Riot Guard,Number three. All fire on my command. Three. Two. One.
Gamora,"You turned off the artificial gravity, everywhere but in here."
Rocket,I told you I had a plan.
Peter Quill,"That was a pretty good plan. Yeah. There it is. Get my ship. Its the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner."
Rocket,They crumpled my pants up into a ball. Thats rude. They folded yours.
Gamora,The orbs there. Lets go.
Peter Quill,"Wait, wait, wait."
Gamora,What.
Peter Quill,That bastard didnt put it back.
Gamora,Put what back.
Peter Quill,"Here. Get them to the ship, I will be right back."
Gamora,How are you gonna possibly.
Peter Quill,Just keep the Milano close by. Go. Go.
Prison Guard,Ow. My neck.
Rocket,"Well, hows he gonna get to us."
Gamora,He declined to share that information with me.
Rocket,"Well, screw this, then. I aint waiting around for some humie with a death wish. You got the orb, right."
Gamora,Yes.
Rocket,"If we dont leave now, we will be blown to bits."
Gamora,No. Were not leaving without the orb.
Drax,"Behold. This one shows spirit. He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan. Companion, what were you retrieving. Youre an imbecile."
Peter Quill,"Woh, woh, woh. Yoh, Ranger Rick. What are you doing. You cant take apart my ship without asking me. See, what is this."
Rocket,"Dont touch that, its a bomb."
Peter Quill,A bomb.
Rocket,Yep.
Peter Quill,And you leave it lying around.
Rocket,I was gonna put it in a box.
Peter Quill,Whats a box gonna do.
Rocket,How about this one.
Peter Quill,No. Woh. Hey. Hey. Leave it alone.
Rocket,Why. What is it.
Peter Quill,Shut up.
Rocket,Hey.
Peter Quill,What is that.
Rocket,Thats for if things get really hardcore. Or if you wanna blow up moons.
Gamora,No ones blowing up moons.
Rocket,You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.
Peter Quill,"So, listen, Im gonna need your buyers coordinates."
Gamora,"Were heading in the right direction, for now."
Peter Quill,"If were gonna work together, you might want to try trusting me a little bit."
Gamora,And how much do you trust me.
Peter Quill,Id trust you a lot more if you told me what this was. Because Im guessing its some kind of weapon.
Gamora,I dont know what it is.
Drax,"If its a weapon, we should use it against Ronan."
Gamora,"Put it down, you fool. Youll destroy us all."
Drax,"Or just you, murderess."
Gamora,"I let you live once, princess."
Drax,I am not a princess.
Peter Quill,Hey. Nobody is killing anybody on my ship. Were stuck together until we get the money.
Drax,I have no interest in money.
Peter Quill,Great. That means more money for the three of us. For the four of us. Partners.
Gamora,"We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you. Ill tell the buyer were on our way. And Quill, your ship is filthy."
Peter Quill,"Oh, she has no idea. If I had a black light, the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting."
Rocket,"You got issues, Quill."
Head Riot Guard,"I swear, I dont know where they went. I swear."
Nebula,"If he knew where they were headed, hed have already told us."
Head Riot Guard,Yeah.
Nebula,"Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison. Well, then, send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant. Find the orb. Any means, any price."
Nebula,And this place.
Ronan,The Nova cant know what were after. Cleanse it.
Yondu Udonta,Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one. I like to stick em all in a row on my control console.
The Broker,I cant tell if youre joking or not.
Kraglin,Hes being fully serious.
The Broker,"In that case, I can show you."
Yondu Udonta,"But first, you gonna tell me what this orb is, and why everybody cares so damn much about it. And then you gonna tell me, who out there might wanna buy it."
The Broker,"Sir, the high-end community is a. The high-end community is a. Its a tight-knit. Tight-knit. The high-end community is a very tight-knit. I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers."
Yondu Udonta,"Now, who again is this buyer of yours."
The Collector,Carina.
Carina,"Yes, Master."
The Collector,"Your people do have elbows, do they not."
Carina,"We do, Master."
The Collector,"Then use them. I dont have to remind you what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me. Do I. Chop, chop. Our guests will be here soon."
Rocket,Heads up. Were inbound.
Peter Quill,Woh.
Drax,What is it.
Gamora,"Its called Knowhere. The severed head of an ancient celestial being. Be wary headed in, rodent. There are no regulations whatsoever here. Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull. The bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid. All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy. Its dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws."
Peter Quill,"Well, I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde and John Stamos."
Drax,It sounds like a place which I would like to visit.
Peter Quill,"Yeah, you should."
Knowhere Kid,Excuse me.
Peter Quill,Watch your wallets.
Knowhere Kid,Can you spare any units.
Rocket,Get out of here. Your buyers in there.
Gamora,We are to wait here for his representative.
Bar Bouncer,Get out of here.
Drax,This is no respectable establishment. What do you expect us to do while we wait. Yes. Yes.
Rocket,Yahoo.
Drax,"My Orloni has won, as I win at all things. Now, lets put more of this liquid into our bodies."
Rocket,Thats the first thing you said that wasnt bat-shit crazy.
Peter Quill,"Man, you wouldnt believe what they charge for fuel out here. I might actually lose money on this job."
Gamora,My connection is making us wait.
Peter Quill,"Its just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty. Where yours is more, Stab, stab. Those are my terms."
Gamora,My father didnt stress diplomacy.
Peter Quill,Thanos.
Gamora,"Hes not my father. When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me. He tortured me, turned me into a weapon. When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan, I.I couldnt stand by and. Why would you risk your life for this."
Peter Quill,"My mother gave it to me. My mom liked to share with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up. I happened to have it on me when I was.the day that she. You know, when I left Earth."
Gamora,What do you do with it.
Peter Quill,Do. Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.
Gamora,Im a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.
Peter Quill,"Really. Well, on my planet, theres a legend about people like you. Its called Footloose. And in it, a great hero named Kevin Bacon, teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well.its the greatest thing there is."
Gamora,Who put the sticks up their butts.
Peter Quill,"What. No, thats just a."
Gamora,That is cruel.
Peter Quill,Its just a phrase people use.
Gamora,The melody is pleasant. No.
Peter Quill,Ow. What the hell.
Gamora,"I know who you are, Peter Quill. And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your.your pelvic sorcery."
Peter Quill,"That is not what is happening here. Oh, no."
Gamora,Stop it.
Peter Quill,Woh. Woh. What are you doing.
Drax,This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about.
Rocket,That is true.
Drax,He has no respect.
Rocket,That is also true.
Peter Quill,Hold on. Hold on.
Rocket,"Keep calling me vermin, tough guy. You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else."
Peter Quill,"Rocket, youre drunk. Alright. No ones laughing at you."
Rocket,"He thinks Im some stupid thing. He does. Well, I didnt ask to get made. I didnt ask to be torn apart, and put back together, over and over and turned into some.some little monster."
Peter Quill,"Rocket, no ones calling you a monster."
Rocket,He called me vermin. She called me rodent. Lets see if you can laugh after five or six good shots to your frickin face.
Peter Quill,"No, no, no, no. Four billion units. Rocket. Come on, man. Hey. Suck it up for one more lousy night and youre rich."
Rocket,Fine. But I cant promise when all this is over Im not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.
Peter Quill,"See. Thats exactly why none of you have any friends. Five seconds after you meet somebody, youre already trying to kill them."
Drax,"We have traveled halfway across the quadrant, and Ronan is no closer to being dead."
Peter Quill,Drax.
Gamora,Let him go. We dont need him.
Carina,"Milady Gamora, Im here to fetch you for my master."
Rocket,"Okay, this isnt creepy at all."
Carina,"We house the galaxys largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manner. I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector."
The Collector,"Oh, my dear Gamora. How wonderful to meet in the flesh."
Gamora,"Lets bypass the formalities, Tivan. We have what we discussed."
The Collector,What is that thing there.
Groot,I am Groot.
The Collector,"I never thought Id meet a Groot. Sir, you must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass. At the moment of your death, of course."
Groot,I am Groot.
Rocket,"Why, so he could turn you into a frickin chair."
The Collector,Thats your pet.
Rocket,His what.
Gamora,"Tivan, we have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this orb."
The Collector,"Very well, then. Let us see what you brought."
Knowhere Civilian,"Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of cotati seeds. No, cases. Last time, you sent me."
Drax,You shall send a message for me.
The Collector,"Oh, my new friends. Before creation itself, there were six singularities. Then the universe exploded into existence, and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots. Infinity Stones. These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength. Observe. These carriers can use the stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field."
Peter Quill,Theres a little pee coming out of me right now.
The Collector,"Once, for a moment, a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves, but even they were quickly destroyed by it. Beautiful. Beyond compare."
Rocket,"Blah, blah, blah. Were all very fascinated, whitey. But wed like to get paid."
The Collector,How would you like to get paid.
Rocket,"What do you think, fancy man. Units."
The Collector,"Very well, then. Carina. Stand back."
Carina,I will no longer be your slave.
The Collector,No.
Peter Quill,What the fff.
Gamora,How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the orb.
Rocket,What do you still have it for.
Peter Quill,"Well what are we gonna do, leave it in there."
Rocket,I cant believe you had that in your purse.
Peter Quill,"Its not a purse, its a knapsack."
Gamora,We have to bring this to the Nova Corps. Theres a chance they can contain it.
Rocket,Are you kidding me. Were wanted by the Nova Corps. Just give it to Ronan.
Peter Quill,So he can destroy the galaxy.
Rocket,"What are you, some Saint all of a sudden. What has the galaxy ever done for you. Why would you wanna save it."
Peter Quill,Because Im one of the idiots who lives in it.
Gamora,"Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the stone to fall into Ronans hands. We have to go back to your ship and deliver it to Nova."
Peter Quill,"Right, right, okay. I think youre right. Or we could give it to somebody whos not going to arrest us, whos really nice for a whole lot of money. I think its a really good balance between both of your points of view."
Gamora,Youre despicable.
Peter Quill,I.
Gamora,"Dishonorable. Faithless. Oh, no."
Drax,At last. Ha-ha-ha. I shall meet my foe and destroy him.
Peter Quill,You called Ronan.
Yondu,"QUILL. Dont you move, boy."
Drax,Ronan the Accuser.
Ronan,You are the one who transmitted the message.
Drax,You killed my wife. You killed my daughter.
Rocket,"I told you, you cant fit. Now, wait here. Ill be back."
Nebula,It is Gamora. She is escaping with the orb.
Drax,No.
Ronan,"Nebula, retrieve the orb."
Nebula,The stone is in the furthest pod. Bring it down.
Peter Quill,"Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano."
Rocket,How. Weve got no weaponry on these things.
Peter Quill,"These pods are industrial grade, theyre nearly indestructible."
Rocket,"Not against Necroblasts, theyre not."
Peter Quill,Thats not what Im saying.
Rocket,Oh.
Peter Quill,Let me borrow your ride.
Ronan,"I dont recall killing your family. I doubt Ill remember killing you, either."
Gamora,"Quill, Im trapped. I cant make it to the Milano, I have to head out."
Peter Quill,What. Wait. These things arent meant to go out there.
Nebula,"You are a disappointment, sister. Of all our siblings, I hated you least."
Gamora,"Nebula, please. If Ronan gets this stone hell kill us all."
Nebula,Not all. You will already be dead.
Nebula,"Ronan, it is done."
Rocket,"Quill, come on. Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes, but theres nothing we can do for her. These pods arent meant to be out here. In a second, were gonna be in the same boat."
Peter Quill,"Aw, damn it."
Rocket,Quill.
Peter Quill,Yondu. Yondu. This is Quill. My coordinates are 2-2-7-K-3-2-4.
Rocket,"Quill. Quill, what are you doing."
Peter Quill,"Just outside Knowhere. If youre there, come get me. Im all yours."
Rocket,"Quill, dont be ridiculous. Get back into your pod. You cant fit two people in there, youre gonna die. Youll die in seconds. Quill."
Gamora,Quill. What happened.
Peter Quill,"I saw you out there. I dont know what came over me, but I couldnt let you die. I found something inside of myself. Something incredibly heroic. I mean, not to brag, but objectively."
Gamora,Wheres the orb.
Peter Quill,"Its.well, they got the orb."
Gamora,What.
Kraglin,"Welcome home, Peter."
Rocket,Blasted idiot. Theyre all idiots. Quill just got himself captured. None of this ever would have happened if you didnt try to single-handedly take on a frickin army.
Drax,"Youre right. I was a fool. All the anger, all the rage, was just to cover my loss."
Rocket,"Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. My wife and child are dead. Oh, I dont care if its mean. Everybodys got dead people. Thats no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way. Come on, Groot. Ronan has the stone. The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe as fast as we can and maybe, just maybe, well be able to live full lives before that whack-job ever gets there."
Groot,I am Groot.
Rocket,Save them. How.
Groot,I am Groot.
Rocket,"I know theyre the only friends that we ever had, but theres an army of Ravagers around them. And theres only two of us."
Drax,Three.
Rocket,Aw. YOURE MAKING ME BEAT - UP - GRASS.
Ronan,"The orb is in my possession, as I promised."
Thanos,Bring it to me.
Ronan,"Yes, that was our agreement. Bring you the orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you."
Thanos,"Boy, I would reconsider your current course."
Korath,Master. You cannot. Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.
Ronan,Not anymore.
Ronan,"You call me boy. I will unfurl one thousand years of Kree justice on Xandar, and burn it to its core. Then, Thanos, Im coming for you."
Nebula,"After Xandar, youre going to kill my father."
Ronan,You dare to oppose me.
Nebula,"You see what he has turned me into. You kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets."
Yondu Udonta,You betrayed me. Steal my money.
Gamora,Stop it. Leave him alone.
Yondu Udonta,"When I picked you up as a kid, these boys wanted to eat you. They aint never tasted Terran before. I saved your life."
Peter Quill,"Oh, will you shut up about that. God. Twenty years, youve been throwing that in my face, like its some great thing, not eating me. Normal people dont even think about eating someone else. Much less that person having to be grateful for it. You abducted me, man. You stole me from my home and from my family."
Yondu Udonta,"You dont give a damn about your Terra. Youre scared because youre soft, in here. Here. Right here."
Gamora,Yondu. Listen to me. Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.
Yondu Udonta,"I know what hes got, girl."
Gamora,Then you know we must get it back. Hes gonna use it to wipe out Xandar. We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.
Yondu Udonta,"Is that what shes been filling your head with, boy. Sentiment. Eating away your brain like maggots. Thats it."
Gamora,No.
Yondu Udonta,"Sorry, boy. But a captains gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him."
Kraglin,Captains gotta teach stuff.
Peter Quill,"If you kill me now, you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen."
Yondu Udonta,The Stone. I hope you got something better than that. Because aint nobody stealing from Ronan.
Peter Quill,We got a ringer.
Yondu Udonta,Is that right.
Peter Quill,"She knows everything there is to know about Ronan. His ships, his army."
Gamora,Hes vulnerable.
Peter Quill,"Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh. Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days."
Yondu Udonta,"Let him go. Oh. You always did have a scrote, boy. Thats why I kept you on as a youngun."
Ravager Pilot,"Captain, the shot was non-damaging."
Rocket,"Attention, idiots. The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer. Its a weapon of my own design."
Yondu Udonta,What the hell.
Rocket,"If you dont hand over our companions now, hes gonna tear your ship a new one. A very big new one."
Yondu Udonta,I aint buyin it.
Rocket,"Im giving you to the count of five. Five, four, three."
Peter Quill,No.
Gamora,"No, no. Dont."
Peter Quill,"No. Wait, hold on. Rocket, its me, for God sakes. We figured it out. Were fine."
Rocket,"Oh, hey, Quill. Whats going on. You call that figured it out. Were gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless."
Peter Quill,"Oh, you want to talk about senseless. How about trying to save us by blowing us up."
Rocket,We were only gonna blow you up if they didnt turn you over.
Peter Quill,And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five.
Rocket,Well we didnt have time to work out the minutiae of the plan. This is what we get for acting altruistically.
Groot,I am Groot.
Rocket,They are ungrateful.
Gamora,Whats important now is we get the Ravagers army to help us save Xandar.
Rocket,So we can give the Stone to Yondu whos just gonna sell to somebody even worse.
Peter Quill,Well figure that part out later.
Gamora,We have to stop Ronan.
Rocket,How.
Peter Quill,I have a plan.
Rocket,Youve got a plan.
Peter Quill,Yes.
Rocket,"First of all, youre copying me from when I said I had a plan."
Peter Quill,"No, Im not. People say that all the time, its not that unique of a thing to say."
Rocket,"Secondly, I dont even believe you have a plan."
Peter Quill,I have part of a plan.
Drax,What percentage of a plan do you have.
Gamora,You dont get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.
Drax,I just saved Quill.
Peter Quill,Weve already established that you destroying the ship that Im on is not saving me.
Drax,When did we establish it.
Peter Quill,Like three seconds ago.
Drax,"I wasnt listening, I was thinking of something else."
Gamora,Oh.
Rocket,"Shes right, you dont get an opinion. What percentage."
Peter Quill,"I dont know, twelve percent."
Rocket,Twelve percent.
Peter Quill,Thats a fake laugh.
Rocket,Its real.
Peter Quill,Totally fake.
Rocket,"That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan."
Gamora,Its barely a concept.
Peter Quill,Youre taking their side.
Groot,I am Groot.
Rocket,"So what, its better than eleven percent. What the hell does that have to do with anything."
Peter Quill,"Thank you, Groot. Thank you. See. Groots the only one of you who has a clue. Guys. Come on. Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds. He expects to hear this big plan of ours. I need your help. I look around at us, you know what I see. Losers. I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff. And we have. Man, we have. All of us. Our homes, our families, normal lives. And, usually, life takes more than it gives, but not today. Today, its given us something. It has given us a chance."
Drax,To do what.
Peter Quill,"To give a shit. For once, not run away. I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives."
Rocket,"But, Quill, stopping Ronan, its impossible. Youre asking us to die."
Peter Quill,"Yeah, I guess I am. I."
Gamora,Quill. I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies. I will be grateful to die among my friends.
Drax,"You are an honorable man, Quill. I will fight beside you. And in the end, see my wife and daughter again."
Groot,I am Groot.
Rocket,"Oh, what the hell. I dont got that long a lifespan, anyway. Now Im standing. You all happy. Were all standing up now. Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle."
Gamora,"The stone reacts to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge."
Peter Quill,"All Ronans gotta do is touch the stone to the planets surface and zap. All plants, animals, Nova Corps."
Gamora,Everything will die.
Peter Quill,"So Ronan does not make the surface. Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Asters starboard hull. Then, our craft and Yondus will enter."
Kraglin,Wont there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside.
Drax,I think of Sakaaran as paper people.
Gamora,"Once they know were on board, Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck. Which I can disable by dismantling the power source."
Peter Quill,"Well make it to the flight deck, and Ill use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan."
Gamora,"Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the stone. Use these devices to contain it. If you touch it, it will kill you."
Peter Quill,"Ill contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us. Hopefully, theyll believe were there to help."
Rocket,Theres one more thing we need to complete the plan. That guys eye.
Peter Quill,"No. No, we dont. No, we dont need that guys eye."
Rocket,"No, seriously, I need it. Its important to me."
Ravager Navigator,"Ronans fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in t-minus fifteen minutes."
Yondu Udonta,"Remember, boy. At the end of all this, I get the stone. You cross me, we kill you all. Lets go get em, boys."
Gamora,This is a terrible plan.
Peter Quill,"Hey, youre the one who said you wanted to die among friends."
Corpsman Dey,Nova Prime. I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers. He says Ronans in possession of something called an Infinity Stone and hes headed toward Xandar.
Nova Prime,Good God.
Denarian Saal,Its a trick. Hes a criminal.
Nova Prime,Did he say why we should believe him.
Corpsman Dey,"He said his crew just escaped from prison so hed have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help. He says that hes an a-hole. But hes not, and Im quoting him here, one hundred percent a dick."
Nova Prime,Do you believe him.
Corpsman Dey,"Well, I dont know that I believe anyones one hundred percent a dick, maam."
Nova Prime,"I mean, do you believe that hes here to help."
Corpsman Dey,Yeah.
Nebula,"A fleet approaches, they appear to be Ravagers."
Yondu Udonta,Fire. Cover it down. Submerge.
Peter Quill,"Rocket, hurry."
Nebula,"All pilots, dive. Theyre beneath us."
Nova Prime,Evacuate the city. Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.
Nebula,"Forward thrust, now."
Kraglin,Come on.
Rocket,Quill. Yondu. Now.
Yondu Udonta,"Aw, hell. Im going down, Quill. No more games with me, boy. Ill see you at the end of this."
Gamora,"There are too many of them, Rocket. Well never make it up there."
Denarian Saal,"Peter Quill, this is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps. For the record, I advised against trusting you here."
Peter Quill,They got my dick message.
Denarian Saal,Prove me wrong.
Drax,Yes. Yes.
Gamora,Were just like Kevin Bacon.
Nebula,The starboard kern has been breached. We have been boarded.
Ronan,Continue our approach.
Nebula,But the Nova Corps have engaged.
Ronan,None of that will matter once we reach the surface.
Nebula,Seal security doors. Now. Get out of my way.
Rocket,"Oh, man."
Nova Prime,"All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade. The Dark Aster must not reach the ground."
Nova Pilot #1,Locked in.
Nova Pilot #2,Locked in. Were locked in.
Drax,I can barely see. When did you learn to do that.
Peter Quill,Im pretty sure the answer is I am Groot.
Gamora,The flight deck is three hundred meters this way.
Drax,"I want you all to know that I am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders. It is pleasing to once again have friends. You, Quill, are my friend."
Peter Quill,Thanks.
Drax,"This dumb tree, he is my friend."
Groot,Mmm.
Drax,"And this green whore, she, too."
Gamora,"Oh, you must stop."
Nebula,"Gamora, look at what you have done. You have always been weak. You stupid, traitorous."
Drax,Nobody talks to my friends like that.
Gamora,Head to the flight deck. Ill shut down the power to the security doors.
Maskless Sakaaran,"Yondu Udonta. Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps. Enough nonsense, Ravager. Time to die."
Gamora,"Nebula, please."
Ronan,"Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots, enact immolation initiative."
Nova Pilot,"Theyre dive-bombing the city. Denarian Saal, should we break formation."
Denarian Saal,No. Hold your positions.
Rocket',"Keep Ronan up there, Saal. Well take care of the people down here."
Denarian Saal,I cant believe Im taking orders from a hamster.
Korath,Star-Lord.
Peter Quill,Finally. You thief.
Korath,You will never make it to Ronan.
Rocket,Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.
Gamora,Come on.
Drax,Finger to the throat means death. Metaphor.
Peter Quill,"Yeah, sorta. Oh, no."
Ronan,"Xandar, you stand accused. Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now. It is the tinder on which you burn."
Denarian Saal,Rocket.
Rocket,"Hold on, Saal, just. Quill, you gotta hurry. The citys been evacuated, but were getting our asses kicked down here."
Peter Quill,Gamora hasnt opened the door.
Gamora,"Nebula. Sister, help us fight Ronan. You know hes crazy."
Nebula,I know youre both crazy.
Gamora,No.
Ravager Pilot,What the.
Nebula,Get out.
Drax,You did it.
Ronan,"I was mistaken, I do remember your family. Their screams were pitiful. I."
Rocket,"No, Groot. You cant, youll die. Why are you doing this. Why."
Groot,We are Groot.
Rocket,I called him an idiot.
Rocket,YOU KILLED GROOT.
Ronan,"Behold. Your Guardians of the Galaxy. What fruit have they wrought. Only that my father and his father shall finally know vengeance. People of Xandar, the time has come to rejoice and renounce your paltry gods. Your salvation is at hand."
Ronan,
Peter Quill,"Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, thingsll get brighter. Listen to these words. Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, thingsll get brighter. Now bring it down hard. Some day, well get it together and well get it."
Ronan,What are you doing.
Peter Quill,"Dance-off, bro. Me and you. Gamora. Subtle. Take it back."
Ronan,What are you doing.
Peter Quill,"Im distracting you, you big turd blossom."
Gamora,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
Gamora,PETER.
Gamora,TAKE MY HAND.
Meredith Quill,"Take my hand, Peter."
Peter Quill,Mom.
Gamora,TAKE MY HAND.
Ronan,YOURE MORTAL. HOW.
Peter Quill,"You said it yourself, bitch. Were the Guardians of the Galaxy."
Yondu Udonta,"Well, well, well. Quite the light show. Aint this sweet. But you got some business to attend to before all the nookie-nookie starts."
Gamora,"Peter, you cant. Peter."
Peter Quill,"You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I dont know who youre selling this to, but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps."
Yondu Udonta,"I may be as pretty as an angel, but I sure as hell aint one. Hand it over, son."
Peter Quill,"Yondu. Do not open that orb. You know that, right. Youve seen what it does to people."
Kraglin,"Yeah, Quill turned out okay. Its probably good we didnt deliver him to his dad like we was hired to do."
Yondu Udonta,"Yeah, that guy was a jackass."
Peter Quill,Hes gonna be so pissed when he realizes I switched out the orb on him.
Gamora,"He was gonna kill you, Peter."
Peter Quill,"Oh, I know. But he was about the only family I had."
Gamora,No. He wasnt.
Peter Quill,Why would you even know this.
Corpsman Dey,"When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system, so we had it checked out."
Peter Quill,Im not Terran.
Nova Prime,"You are half Terran. Your mother was of earth. Your father, well, hes something very ancient weve never seen here before."
Gamora,That could be why you were able to hold the stone for as long as you did.
Nova Prime,"Your friends have arrived. On behalf of the Nova Corps, wed like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving Xandar. If you will follow Denarian Dey, he has something to show you."
Peter Quill,"Thank you, Nova Prime."
Gamora,Thank you.
Gamora,Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.
Drax,"Yes. Of course, Ronan was only a puppet. Its really Thanos I need to kill."
Corpsman Dey,We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible. We salvaged as much as we could.
Peter Quill,Wow. I… Thank you.
Corpsman Dey,"I have a family who are alive because of you. Your criminal records have also been expunged. However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future."
Rocket,"Question. What if I see something that I want to take, and it belongs to someone else."
Corpsman Dey,Well you will be arrested.
Rocket,But what if I want it more than the person who has it.
Corpsman Dey,Still illegal.
Rocket,"That doesnt follow. No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand. What are you laughing at. Why. I cant have a discussion with this gentleman."
Drax,What if someone does something irksome and I decide to remove his spine.
Corpsman Dey,"Thats.thats actually murder. Its one of the worst crimes of all, so also illegal."
Drax,Hmm.
Peter Quill,"Theyll be fine, Dey. Im gonna keep an eye on em."
Corpsman Dey,You.
Peter Quill,"Yeah, me."
Meredith Quill,"Peter, I know these last few months have been hard for you. But Im going to a better place and I will be okay. And I will always be with you. You are the light of my life. My precious son. My little Star-Lord. Love, mom."
Peter Quill,"So, what should we do next. Something good. Something bad. A bit of both."
Gamora,"Well follow your lead, Star-Lord."
Peter Quill,Bit of both.
