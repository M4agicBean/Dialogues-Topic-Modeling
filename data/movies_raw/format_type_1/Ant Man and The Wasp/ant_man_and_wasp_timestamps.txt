00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I still think
about the night</i></font>

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>your mother and I
had to leave you.</i></font>

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hopefully,
it's not for long,</font>

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'll call you
when we get settled.</font>

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I have a better
indication of what's going on.</font>

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy?</font>

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jellybean.</font>

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...</font>

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.</font>

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I don't want you to go.</font>

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.</font>

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't be able to keep my...</font>

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">eyes...</font>

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.</font>

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet, we gotta go.</font>

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I wish we could have
put down our bags...</i></font>

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>tucked you back
into your bed...</i></font>

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but too many lives
were at stake.</i></font>

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've already launched.</font>

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to stop it.</font>

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...</i></font>

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but the plating was too thick.</i></font>

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i></font>

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't get through.</font>

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank.</font>

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We both knew
that if you go that small...</i></font>

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>there is no coming back.</i></font>

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It should have been me,
but my regulator was damaged.</i></font>

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Your mother's wasn't.</i></font>

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell Hope I love her.</font>

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She turned it off.</i></font>

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet. No!</font>

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.</i></font>

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day</i></font>

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.</i></font>

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Alone.</i></font>

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Afraid.</i></font>

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Gone forever.</i></font>

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...</i></font>

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i></font>

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then Scott showed up.</font>

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or should I say,
broke into our house.</font>

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i></font>

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and came back.</i></font>

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Everything changed.</i></font>

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I started to wonder...</font>

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could your mother
still be alive?</font>

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I dusted off
some old plans.</font>

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, what are you saying?</font>

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's possible
to bring her back.</font>

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. We're in.</font>

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, this place is a maze.</font>

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's that map?</font>

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're definitely close.</font>

58
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.</font>

59
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,</font>

60
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.</font>

61
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I eat fear for breakfast.</font>

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. That is super cool.</font>

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.</font>

65
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anton, which way do we go?</font>

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anton, which way do we go?</font>

67
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Anton!</font>

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.</font>

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh no, lasers!</font>

70
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! I think I got lased!</font>

71
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The secret vault.</font>

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me you brought
the contact lens.</font>

73
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yup.</font>

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect! Right there.</font>

75
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There!
It's the micro-treasure!</font>

76
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My trophy?</font>

77
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like treasure.</font>

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it is to me.</font>

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to take it
to show-and-tell.</font>

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, you can't do that.</font>

81
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.</font>

82
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.</font>

83
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so touched you think</font>

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the world's
greatest grandma.</font>

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the only one they had.</font>

86
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.</font>

87
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, the fuzz!</font>

88
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Scotty...</font>

89
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was looking
at the schematics</font>

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the
Karapetyan buildings...</font>

91
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I think we have</font>

92
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">way too many security cameras,
don't we?</font>

93
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, not at all.</font>

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, 'cause it's a lot of
security cameras.</font>

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what he needs.</font>

96
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the security expert
in our business?</font>

97
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are, but I'm running
the company, right?</font>

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if we overquote him...</font>

99
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's gonna go somewhere else.</font>

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
we gotta land this bird.</font>

101
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He ain't goin' anywhere.</font>

102
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the expression is
"land this fish."</font>

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's "land the bird."</font>

104
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like you land the plane.</font>

105
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta land the plane
to be in business.</font>

106
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's silly
to get hung up</font>

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on these kinds of things,
but I do.</font>

108
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I gonna land a fish?</font>

109
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...</font>

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?</font>

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've really turned me around
on this thing.</font>

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.</font>

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if you just excuse me...</font>

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in the middle of trying to</font>

115
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">steal something
with my daughter.</font>

116
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go recheck it.</font>

117
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the escape ant!</font>

118
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!</font>

119
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The po-po?
How do you even know that?</font>

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!</font>

121
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crash landing!</font>

122
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish we could shrink
for real.</font>

124
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. That is pretty cool.</font>

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.</font>

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.</font>

127
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I feel
like I'm way better.</font>

128
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.</font>

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my hands are shaking.</font>

130
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think it's unrelated,
you know?</font>

131
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be great, Luis!</font>

132
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got nothing
to worry about!</font>

133
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.</font>

134
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy!</font>

136
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Woo!
I've got 3 days left.</font>

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I try to escape?</font>

138
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.</font>

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.</font>

140
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keel to stern, soup to nuts.</font>

141
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

142
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.</font>

143
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our flying ant crashed.</font>

144
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old</font>

145
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you can't leave
the house.</font>

146
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the lengths
that I've gone to?</font>

147
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close-up magic.</font>

148
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I learned that.</font>

149
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?</font>

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Cassie.</font>

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing</font>

152
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">grown-up stuff to you, huh?</font>

153
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, think of it this way.</font>

154
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your school has rules, right?</font>

155
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, you can't draw
on the walls.</font>

156
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, your daddy
went to Germany</font>

157
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and drew on the walls
with Captain America.</font>

158
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that was a violation
of Article 16,</font>

159
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paragraph 3
of the Sokovia Accords.</font>

160
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...</font>

161
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with Homeland Security
and the German government...</font>

162
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he was allowed to return
to the U.S...</font>

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">provided he serve 2 years
under house arrest...</font>

164
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">followed by 3 years
of probation.</font>

165
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...</font>

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or contact with any
former associates who were...</font>

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or currently are
in violation of said Accords.</font>

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or any related statutes.</font>

169
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, sweetie?</font>

170
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. You're really great
with kids.</font>

171
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.</font>

172
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...</font>

173
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you haven't had
any contact</font>

174
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?</font>

175
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- You sure?</font>

176
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.</font>

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.</font>

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And associating with them
breaks your deal.</font>

179
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...</font>

180
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that any violation
of your agreement</font>

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.</font>

182
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.</font>

183
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They hate his guts.</font>

184
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, peanut.</font>

185
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you do it, Scott?</font>

186
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what?</font>

187
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The card trick.</font>

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?</font>

189
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You people
can't just show up here</font>

191
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whenever you want
and search the place.</font>

192
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, they can.</font>

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need a warrant.</font>

194
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, they don't.</font>

195
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Wow.</font>

196
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you pack
your soccer shoes?</font>

197
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- All right.</font>

198
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time I see you will be
on the outside.</font>

199
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

200
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, get on the inside of this.</font>

201
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, 3 days.
Seriously...</font>

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thank you.</font>

203
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
Give me another one.</font>

204
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!</font>

205
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New business!
I am sensing greatness.</font>

206
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a fun weekend, Daddy.</font>

207
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.</font>

208
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once I'm outta here,</font>

209
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.</font>

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.</font>

211
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gettin' good at that.</font>

212
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you do that?</font>

213
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.</font>

214
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

215
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 days.</font>

216
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy-peasy.</font>

217
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.</i></font>

218
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And that is misdirection.</i></font>

219
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We had a dream</i></font>

220
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We'd go travelin' together</i></font>

221
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on</i></font>

222
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Easy-peasy.</font>

223
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Where are you?</i></font>

224
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Everything
that you know...</i></font>

225
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Lost...</i></font>

226
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>in the quantum realm.</i></font>

227
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What?</i></font>

228
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna find you,
Jellybean.</font>

229
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found you!</font>

230
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You always find me, Mommy.</font>

231
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What the hell?</i></font>

232
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.</font>

233
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.</font>

234
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm probably
the last person</font>

235
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you wanna hear from.</font>

236
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I just had
a really weird dream.</font>

237
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I know that doesn't</font>

238
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sound like an emergency
or anything...</font>

239
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it just felt very real.</font>

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was back
in the quantum realm...</font>

241
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I think I saw your wife.</font>

242
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I was your wife.</font>

243
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.</font>

244
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
hearing this out loud,</font>

245
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.</font>

246
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to bother you.</font>

247
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry for a lot of things.</font>

248
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...</i></font>

249
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Could be one,
little, tiny universe.</i></font>

250
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope?</font>

251
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this another dream?</font>

252
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think it was a dream...</font>

253
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?</font>

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure.</font>

255
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't be here!</font>

256
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!</font>

257
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.</font>

258
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!</font>

259
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,</font>

260
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're still at home.</font>

261
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

262
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scotty?</font>

263
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.</i></font>

264
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9 hours in bed.</font>

265
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 hours in front of the TV.</font>

266
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.</font>

267
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's totally inaccurate.</font>

268
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how do you know
about my daily routine?</font>

269
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you spying on me?</font>

270
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?</font>

271
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.</font>

272
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.</font>

273
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said it was
a matter of national security.</font>

274
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That Cap needed help, so...</font>

275
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cap?</font>

276
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tain America.
Captain. Cap.</font>

277
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what we call him.</font>

278
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're a friend.</font>

279
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.</font>

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's nice. Whatever.</font>

281
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.</font>

282
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't think
about a lot of things.</font>

283
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's Hank?</font>

284
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.</font>

285
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you think he is?</font>

286
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I know you're mad.</font>

287
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.</font>

288
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only reason
why we're even talking is...</font>

289
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because we need
what's in your head.</font>

290
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this where you're living?</font>

291
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...</font>

292
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're fine.</font>

293
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...</font>

294
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save it!</font>

295
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can we start?
- Yeah.</font>

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, while you were relaxing
at home...</font>

297
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we were building this.</font>

298
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.</font>

299
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To my mom.</font>

300
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We think she might still
be down there.</font>

301
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just don't know where.</font>

302
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

303
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...</font>

304
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then the pod can take me down
to get her.</font>

305
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You built all this
and you don't even know</font>

306
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if she's alive?</font>

307
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called a hypothesis.</font>

308
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.</font>

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was overloaded
and it shut down.</font>

310
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But for a split second,</font>

311
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.</font>

312
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And?</font>

313
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And 5 minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.</font>

314
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We think
when you were down there,</font>

315
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you may have entangled
with her.</font>

316
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.</font>

317
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quantum entanglement, Scott.</font>

318
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We think she might have put</font>

319
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">some kind of a message
in your head.</font>

320
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hopefully, a location.</font>

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And opening the tunnel
triggered it.</font>

322
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mom put a message
in my head?</font>

323
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. That's insane.</font>

324
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Scott.</font>

325
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Insane is going to Germany</font>

326
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.</font>

327
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.</font>

328
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me
you really destroyed it.</font>

329
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did, I destroyed it,
I swear.</font>

330
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!</font>

331
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was my life's work!</font>

332
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was I supposed to do?</font>

333
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were supposed to not
take my suit!</font>

334
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Hank!</font>

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I took the suit.</font>

336
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry
that I called last night.</font>

337
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.</font>

338
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish that I did.</font>

339
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just had a dream about her</font>

340
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.</font>

341
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

342
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a dream.</font>

343
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.</font>

344
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie and I do it
all the time.</font>

345
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't mean anything.</font>

346
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But was it Cassie
in the dream?</font>

347
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

348
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where was she hiding?</font>

349
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- The little girl.</font>

350
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?</font>

351
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was in a tall dresser.</font>

352
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean a wardrobe.</font>

353
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what that's called?</font>

354
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What color was it?</font>

355
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Red.</font>

356
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were there horses on it?</font>

357
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy.</font>

358
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's where I hid
every time that we played.</font>

359
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't sound like</font>

360
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you really got the gist
of the game.</font>

361
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's alive.</font>

362
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it.</font>

363
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it!</font>

364
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get that part.</font>

365
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

366
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sooner we get
the tunnel working...</font>

367
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.</font>

368
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does Burch have it?</font>

369
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Let's go.
- What part?</font>

370
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?</font>

371
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need a component
to stop the tunnel</font>

372
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from overloading again.</font>

373
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.</font>

374
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'd really like
to help you...</font>

375
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if I'm not at home
when they come</font>

376
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to take off
my ankle monitor...</font>

377
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I'm going away forever.</font>

378
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...</font>

379
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.</font>

380
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.</font>

381
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You owe us.</font>

382
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?</font>

383
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.</font>

384
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

385
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We good?
- Yeah.</font>

386
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right back.</font>

387
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I have one of these?
- No.</font>

388
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui!</font>

389
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonny!</font>

390
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oui is French
for "yes."</font>

391
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...</font>

392
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and "yes" to planet
before profit.</font>

393
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"</font>

394
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"</font>

395
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.</font>

396
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a seat.</font>

397
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm good. Thank you.</font>

398
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is this guy?</font>

399
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.</font>

400
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.</font>

401
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could I just have one...</font>

402
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.</font>

404
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I say "special"...</font>

405
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because, well,
he tells me things</font>

406
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I didn't previously know.</font>

407
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For example...</font>

408
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your name isn't Susan.</font>

409
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Hope Van Dyne.</font>

410
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.</font>

411
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.</font>

412
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

413
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.</font>

414
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.</font>

415
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our relationship?</font>

416
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.</font>

417
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...</font>

418
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but now, Hank Pym...</font>

419
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank Pym
is a real opportunity.</font>

420
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a point?</font>

421
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you think
that I don't know</font>

422
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you've been building
with all this?</font>

423
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quantum technology.</font>

424
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,</font>

425
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">forget cryptocurrency.</font>

426
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quantum energy is the future.</font>

427
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the next gold rush.</font>

428
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that so?</font>

429
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want in, Hope.</font>

430
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...</font>

431
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of arranging some buyers
for your lab.</font>

432
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Starting bid...</font>

433
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one billion dollars.</font>

434
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Sonny, really.</font>

435
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my father and I
have something</font>

436
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">slightly more pressing
than starting a business.</font>

437
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'll just take
the component as arranged.</font>

438
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My buyers don't take no
for an answer.</font>

439
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we are
either in business together...</font>

440
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or we aren't
in business together.</font>

441
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I guess we aren't.</font>

442
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can go.</font>

443
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.</font>

444
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.</font>

445
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Sonny.</font>

446
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody</font>

447
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you just give me
that component.</font>

448
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...</font>

449
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is my heart,
but it will mend in time.</font>

450
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

451
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now what?</font>

452
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll see.</font>

453
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.</font>

454
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to know what it is</font>

455
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because if they're not working
with us...</font>

456
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're working with somebody.
So find out.</font>

457
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want some names...</font>

458
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, you gave her wings?</font>

459
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get her.</font>

460
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!</font>

461
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop firing! Stop!</font>

462
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!</font>

463
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

464
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wings and blasters.</font>

465
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.</font>

466
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I did.</font>

467
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.</font>

468
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.</font>

469
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can assure you of that!</font>

470
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What in the hell is that?</font>

471
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad,
are you seeing this?</font>

472
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope, get out of there!</font>

473
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I gotta do something.
- Wait!</font>

474
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is still
a work in progress.</font>

475
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You taught me
that kick. Remember?</font>

476
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, great form.</font>

477
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?</font>

478
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not the time, Scott.</font>

479
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, where'd it go?</font>

480
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lost it.</font>

481
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i></font>

482
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Try looking...</i></font>

483
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

484
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that.</font>

485
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now.</font>

486
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- No!</font>

487
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He got the lab.</font>

488
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

489
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

490
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

491
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

492
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we need to find somewhere
to regroup</font>

493
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and figure out
where the lab is.</font>

494
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where to now?</font>

495
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about my house? Hmm?</font>

496
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm supposed
to be there anyway,</font>

497
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Woo could walk in
any second.</font>

498
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly why we're not going
to your house.</font>

499
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your house?</font>

500
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

501
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there is one place
I can think of.</font>

502
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

503
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no!</font>

504
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

505
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, Dr. Pym...</font>

506
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who would've thought that,</font>

507
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">once again,
in your hour of need...</font>

508
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you would turn to us,
you know?</font>

509
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not me.</font>

510
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Help yourself.</font>

511
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?</font>

512
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta keep
the food budget down.</font>

513
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?</font>

514
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The oatmeal packets.</font>

515
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oatmeal packets.</font>

516
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's insult.
- Why is it an insult?</font>

517
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it tastes like sand.</font>

518
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know why?
'Cause it's organic.</font>

519
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not organic, it's sand.</font>

520
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the most important meal
of the day.</font>

521
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what,
you can get creative with it.</font>

522
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Break teeth.</font>

523
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put a little brown sugar on
it. You can put some cinnamon.</font>

524
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...</font>

525
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.</font>

526
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got bigger fish to fry.</font>

527
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that my desk?</font>

528
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- What?</font>

529
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do I have
such a small desk?</font>

530
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.</font>

531
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You snooze, you lose.</font>

532
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I was
under house arrest.</font>

533
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

534
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what,
this isn't even a desk.</font>

535
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is garbage.</font>

536
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You found this outside
amongst garbage.</font>

537
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it at a rummage sale.</font>

538
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you save money
on my desk?</font>

539
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys.</font>

540
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?</font>

541
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.</font>

542
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,</font>

543
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like what happened to you.</font>

544
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.</font>

545
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a ghost.</font>

546
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Baba Yaga.</font>

547
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baba Yaga, the witch.</font>

548
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They tell stories to children
to frighten them.</font>

549
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Baba Yaga?</font>

550
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever stole it...</font>

551
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we need to find it.</font>

552
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.</font>

553
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Baba Yaga.</font>

554
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.</font>

555
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?</font>

556
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because if you didn't,</font>

557
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have a variety
of affordable options.</font>

558
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.</font>

559
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.</font>

560
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They also looked like
they were phasing.</font>

561
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Phasing?</font>

562
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quantum phasing.
When an object moves</font>

563
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">through different states
of matter.</font>

564
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.</font>

565
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lab emits radiation.</font>

566
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?</font>

567
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.</font>

568
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where else can we find
that equipment?</font>

569
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there is one person.</font>

570
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bill Foster.</font>

571
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great!</font>

572
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's Bill Foster?</font>

573
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

574
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They had a falling out
years ago.</font>

575
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.</font>

576
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's probably
just a waste of time.</font>

577
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.</font>

578
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you think
we should check?</font>

579
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to find out
who took the lab.</font>

580
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys,
it's not a good idea</font>

581
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be out in the open
like this.</font>

582
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.</font>

583
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, because of hats
and sunglasses?</font>

584
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a disguise, Hank.</font>

585
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.</font>

586
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>In an isolated system...</i></font>

587
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.</font>

588
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the system
is interfered with,</font>

589
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that stability becomes chaos.</font>

590
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unpredictable.</font>

591
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dangerous.
Beautiful.</font>

592
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isolated completely,
a quantum system</font>

593
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would revert back to
separate states of matter...</font>

594
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.</font>

595
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words,
the object in question</font>

596
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would be both
in and out of phase...</font>

597
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with multiple
parallel realities.</font>

598
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.</font>

599
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am noticing
an unusually high number</font>

600
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of glazed eyes out there
among you.</font>

601
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?</font>

602
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'll be enough for today.</font>

603
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.</font>

604
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.</font>

605
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of</font>

606
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Posner molecules
in your brains.</font>

607
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.</font>

608
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"</font>

609
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in front of everything?</font>

610
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor, we need to
find our lab.</font>

611
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope, I'd love to help you...</font>

612
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't have anything</font>

613
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like the equipment
you're describing.</font>

614
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.</font>

615
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't condescend, Hank.</font>

616
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.</font>

617
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All because
you had to grow to a size</font>

618
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that finally fit your ego.</font>

619
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.</font>

620
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

621
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.</font>

622
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I slept for 3 days
straight. You have no idea.</font>

623
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I do.</font>

624
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner</font>

625
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on a project called Goliath.</font>

626
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?
You were my partner?</font>

627
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing more tiring
than going that big</font>

628
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.</font>

629
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right...</font>

630
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
How big did you get?</font>

631
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My record? 21 feet.</font>

632
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not bad.
- You?</font>

633
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't...</font>

634
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, really, I'm curious.</font>

635
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 65 feet. Yeah.
- Whoa!</font>

636
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Huge.
- 65.</font>

637
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you two are finished
comparing sizes...</font>

638
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.</font>

639
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?</font>

640
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange.</font>

641
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had all the answers
back in the day.</font>

642
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I left the project.</font>

643
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Left? I fired you.</font>

644
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Best decision
I ever made.</font>

645
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...</font>

646
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stubborn, impatient.</font>

647
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.</font>

648
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the mediocrities.</font>

649
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet was the only one
who could endure him</font>

650
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and chose to stick it out.</font>

651
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it, Bill.</font>

652
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She paid the price,
though, didn't she?</font>

653
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You son of a bitch.</font>

654
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.</font>

655
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to save my mother.</font>

656
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, which office
would you say?</font>

657
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's Woo.</font>

658
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone must have seen me.</font>

659
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. If this is about you,</font>

660
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they'd be in your house
by now.</font>

661
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you, 15?</font>

662
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
We gotta go right now.</font>

663
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...</font>

664
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you modify
the diffraction units</font>

665
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on one of your regulators.</font>

666
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.</font>

667
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Thank you.</font>

668
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, Doctor,
campus police says</font>

669
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they ID'd both Pym
and Van Dyne.</font>

670
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.</font>

671
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.</font>

672
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can assure you
I'm the last person</font>

673
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he would want to visit.</font>

674
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on,
you expect us to...</font>

675
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey.</font>

676
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is that?</font>

677
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simple.
We hate each other's guts.</font>

678
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm a terrible partner?</font>

679
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea</font>

680
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in his unremarkable career.</font>

681
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?</font>

682
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine, one decent idea.</font>

683
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except, I eliminated
the diffractors</font>

684
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I upgraded the suits.</font>

685
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if we had an old suit,</font>

686
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we might be able
to track down the lab?</font>

687
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but we don't.</font>

688
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What if we did?
- What do you mean?</font>

689
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean...</font>

690
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">life's funny.</font>

691
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.</font>

692
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

693
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.</font>

694
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't destroy that.</font>

695
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before I turned myself in,</font>

696
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.</font>

697
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sent my suit
through the mail?</font>

698
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.</font>

699
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.</font>

700
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it?</font>

701
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.</font>

702
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.</font>

703
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?</font>

704
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I looked everywhere.
It's not here.</font>

705
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, get away from the plant.</font>

706
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I put it back
after Cassie and I...</font>

707
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show-and-tell.</font>

708
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scotty?</font>

709
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, stop!</font>

710
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the good news is
I know where it is.</font>

711
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whenever you go
back to school...</font>

712
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?</font>

713
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place seems huge.</font>

714
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What is it?</i></font>

715
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the new regulator.</font>

716
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, what's going on
with this suit?</font>

717
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much of
a work in progress is this?</font>

718
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.
No, no, no.</font>

719
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

720
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...</font>

721
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.</font>

722
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What do you see?</i></font>

723
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.</font>

724
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me...</font>

725
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow!</font>

726
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- It's all right.</font>

727
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
All right.</font>

728
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try that.</font>

729
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

730
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

731
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome.</font>

732
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If only Cap could see you now.</font>

733
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?</font>

734
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

735
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your hall pass?</font>

736
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm talking to you.</font>

737
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

738
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Eh...</font>

739
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do it.</font>

740
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You almost got it.</font>

741
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, peanut.</font>

742
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's go.</font>

743
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiya, champ,
how was school today?</font>

744
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, get your jokes out
now. Can you fix the suit?</font>

745
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So cranky.</font>

746
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want a juice box
and some string cheese?</font>

747
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really have that?</font>

748
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see
if Foster was right.</font>

749
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This has gotta be the lab.</font>

750
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go get it.</font>

751
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

752
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This seems right.</font>

753
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at us, teaming up twice
in one day.</font>

754
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Makes you think, huh?</font>

755
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About what?</font>

756
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Germany.</font>

757
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

758
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were working together,
training together...</font>

759
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and other stuffing together.</font>

760
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I had asked you,
would you have come?</font>

761
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we'll never know.</font>

762
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do know one thing.</font>

763
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

764
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I had,
you'd have never been caught.</font>

765
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Scott.</font>

766
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter</font>

767
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">long enough to get my lab?</font>

768
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.</font>

769
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you're transmitting.</font>

770
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What took you so long?</font>

771
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.</font>

772
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.</font>

773
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like it?</font>

774
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hilarious.</font>

775
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i></font>

776
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.</font>

777
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Be careful.</i></font>

778
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!</font>

779
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.
It's just the suit.</font>

780
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do you know?
- Look.</font>

781
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Ghost?</font>

782
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is she doing?</font>

783
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think
that suit is how</font>

784
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she goes through walls
and stuff?</font>

785
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.</font>

786
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope,
look! There's the lab.</font>

787
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building</font>

788
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and not
somebody else's, right?</font>

789
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.</font>

790
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get it.</font>

791
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit...</font>

792
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope. Hope! Hank.</font>

793
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys.</font>

794
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
they can hear you.</font>

795
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

796
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Ava.</font>

797
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott.</font>

798
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you don't need the suit...</font>

799
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to go through things.</font>

800
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

801
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just helps me control it.</font>

802
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the pain, supposedly.</font>

803
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna reach
into my chest</font>

804
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and crush my heart, are you?</font>

805
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're funny.</font>

806
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.</font>

807
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need...</font>

808
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what's in your head.</font>

809
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's wake up
the rest of the gang</font>

810
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and get this over with,
shall we?</font>

811
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up!</font>

812
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

813
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

814
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't ever touch him again.</font>

815
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, now, Hope...</font>

816
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,</font>

817
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all things considered.</font>

818
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell
are you talking about?</font>

819
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.</font>

820
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bill.</font>

821
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you done?</font>

822
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.</font>

823
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're with her?</font>

824
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.</font>

825
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell
is going on here?</font>

826
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.</font>

827
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would he?</font>

828
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elihas Starr.</font>

829
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

830
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quantum research.</font>

831
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.</font>

832
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had him fired.</font>

833
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and discredited
for good measure.</font>

834
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father tried to continue
his research on his own.</font>

835
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.</font>

836
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

837
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too many.</font>

838
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Until something went wrong.</i></font>

839
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He told us to run.</font>

840
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elihas, what's happening?</font>

841
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just go. Go!</font>

842
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy! Daddy!</font>

843
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I could tell
he was scared.</i></font>

844
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy!</font>

845
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ava, no!</font>

846
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I didn't want him
to be alone.</i></font>

847
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

848
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When I woke up,
my parents were dead.</i></font>

849
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I wasn't so lucky.</i></font>

850
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."</i></font>

851
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A rather dull name, I think.</i></font>

852
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i></font>

853
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every cell in my body
is torn apart...</font>

854
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and stitched back together.</font>

855
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over and over.</font>

856
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every day.</font>

857
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call</font>

858
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.</font>

859
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Ava.</font>

860
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name's Bill.</font>

861
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a friend
of your father's.</font>

862
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought you something.</font>

863
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.
Try again.</font>

864
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

865
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.</i></font>

866
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

867
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">saw an opportunity
in my affliction.</font>

868
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They built me
a containment suit,</i></font>

869
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,479

870
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And trained me
to be a stealth operative.</i></font>

871
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They weaponized me.</i></font>

872
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I stole for them.
Spied for them.</i></font>

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Killed for them.</i></font>

874
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in exchange for my soul...</font>

875
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they were going to cure me.</font>

876
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They lied.</font>

877
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.</font>

878
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built the chamber
to slow her decay,</font>

879
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but her condition
was progressive.</font>

880
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know how to cure it.</font>

881
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...</font>

882
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that she should
watch you instead.</font>

883
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sure enough,
she discovered</font>

884
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you were
building the tunnel.</font>

885
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, she told me about Lang.</font>

886
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the message from Janet
inside his head,</font>

887
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's when I...</font>

888
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christ's sake!</font>

889
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me. I'm sorry.</font>

890
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?</font>

891
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Cassie, 911."</font>

892
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.</font>

893
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's not happening.</font>

894
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.</font>

895
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not making
demands here, Lang.</font>

896
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...</font>

897
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.</font>

898
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.</font>

899
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?</font>

900
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I can't find my soccer shoes.</i></font>

901
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

902
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I have a game tomorrow.</i></font>

903
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.</i></font>

904
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i></font>

905
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I can't do that right now.</font>

906
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Why not?</i>
- Because I'm sick.</font>

907
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hey, can you just
maybe look around</i></font>

908
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>later then and call me back?</i></font>

909
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Please? Thank you.</i></font>

910
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Bye, Daddy!</i></font>

911
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye, peanut!
- Feel better!</font>

912
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Feel better, buddy!</i></font>

913
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
It said emergency.</font>

914
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ava, I want to help you.</font>

915
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.</font>

916
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, really? How?</font>

917
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet.</font>

918
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the last 30 years,
she's been down there</font>

919
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">absorbing quantum energy.</font>

920
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can extract that energy.</font>

921
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...</font>

922
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Extract it?</font>

923
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Are you insane?</font>

924
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would rip Janet apart.</font>

925
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.</font>

926
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When Janet's location</font>

927
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...</font>

928
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.</font>

929
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

930
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are gonna
stay here...</font>

931
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just in case I need your help.</font>

932
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like hell I would help you!</font>

933
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll do whatever I say.</font>

934
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna kill Janet!</font>

935
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.</font>

936
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn it, Bill!</font>

937
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.</font>

938
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So help me God...</font>

939
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The pills.</font>

940
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's his heart!
He needs his pills.</font>

941
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.</font>

942
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could die!</font>

943
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

944
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help him!</font>

945
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, just hang on,
all right?</font>

946
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.</font>

947
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help him, man! Come on!</font>

948
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Altoid tin!</font>

949
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

950
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, guys.</font>

951
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank!</font>

952
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.</font>

953
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.</font>

954
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.</font>

955
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.</font>

956
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.</font>

957
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good job.</font>

958
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll work.</font>

959
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.</font>

960
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we'll adjust the relays</font>

961
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?</font>

962
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's going to be fine.</font>

963
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this is it.</font>

964
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. You'd think
with all this time</font>

965
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to prepare I'd be more ready.</font>

966
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.</font>

967
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It kind of melts your mind.</font>

968
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean seeing my mom again.</font>

969
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

970
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if she's a completely
different person?</font>

971
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.</font>

972
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious, Scott.</font>

973
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or George Jefferson.</font>

974
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if she's forgotten
about me?</font>

975
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was in prison...</font>

976
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.</font>

977
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could have been locked up
for 100 years...</font>

978
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never would have
forgotten her.</font>

979
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know your mom
is counting the minutes</font>

980
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until she can see you again.</font>

981
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

982
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

983
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a big problem.</font>

984
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You forgot
the motion sensor lights</font>

985
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the back of the building.</font>

986
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

987
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're on the proposal,</font>

988
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.</font>

989
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.</font>

990
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.</font>

991
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no, no.</font>

992
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The meeting is first thing
in the morning.</font>

993
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta come right now
and fix it.</font>

994
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.</font>

995
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what,
I'm coming to you.</font>

996
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.</font>

997
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you can fix them there.</font>

998
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just tell me
where you are, okay?</font>

999
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's complicated.</font>

1000
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean
it's complicated?</font>

1001
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see, sir,</font>

1002
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this system
is state of the art.</font>

1003
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Security of tomorrow, today.</font>

1004
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's so good!</font>

1005
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.</font>

1006
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,</font>

1007
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we can fix the plans.</font>

1008
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.</font>

1009
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- As you can see...
- Oh, oh, oh!</font>

1010
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.</font>

1011
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down to the undercarriage,
baby.</font>

1012
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?</font>

1013
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you said get the works.</font>

1014
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.</font>

1015
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's right.</font>

1016
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The undercarriage wash,</font>

1017
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's for cleaning
off road salt...</font>

1018
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.</font>

1019
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you,
and why do you know so much</font>

1020
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about car wash protocol?</font>

1021
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, my name is Sonny Burch.</font>

1022
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I do my research, Luis.</font>

1023
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...</font>

1024
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the FBI that you are</font>

1025
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a known associate
of Scott Lang...</font>

1026
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...</font>

1027
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has a portable
shrinking laboratory...</font>

1028
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.</font>

1029
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're gonna tell me
where it is.</font>

1030
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I hate to
break it to you,</font>

1031
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't know
what you're talking about.</font>

1032
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.</font>

1033
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.</font>

1034
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.</font>

1035
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now...</font>

1036
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uzman is a master</font>

1037
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at extracting information
from the unwilling...</font>

1038
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">through psychoactive means.</font>

1039
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, is that truth serum?</font>

1040
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no such thing
as truth serum.</font>

1041
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just nonsense from TV.</font>

1042
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what is it then?</font>

1043
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a little concoction</font>

1044
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.</font>

1045
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.</font>

1046
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, dude,
that's truth serum.</font>

1047
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not.</font>

1048
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.</font>

1049
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right?
- It's not a truth serum.</font>

1050
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Hey, I believe you.</font>

1051
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a truth serum.</font>

1052
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...</font>

1053
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth serum.</font>

1054
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I have
a lot of allergies...</font>

1055
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you might wanna think
about that.</font>

1056
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got to get
that lab back.</font>

1057
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1058
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.</font>

1059
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long have I got?</font>

1060
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A couple of weeks, maybe.</font>

1061
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.</font>

1062
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

1063
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lang. He has
a daughter, right?</font>

1064
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't mean that.</font>

1065
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ava!</font>

1066
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...</font>

1067
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I won't be a part
of anything like that.</font>

1068
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the one who's about</font>

1069
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to fade away
into nothing, Bill.</font>

1070
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am!</font>

1071
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you could fix me!</font>

1072
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You promised.</font>

1073
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I will.</font>

1074
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not like that.</font>

1075
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lay one finger
on that little girl...</font>

1076
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't help you.
And we're done.</font>

1077
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

1078
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are other options.</font>

1079
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.</font>

1080
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I don't feel anything.</font>

1081
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was a lie.
I do feel something.</font>

1082
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is truth serum!</font>

1083
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no such thing!</font>

1084
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1085
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.</font>

1086
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.</font>

1087
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1088
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Scott Lang?</font>

1089
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, see, that's complicated.</font>

1090
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.</font>

1091
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.</i></font>

1092
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i></font>

1093
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"</i></font>

1094
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.</i></font>

1095
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...</i></font>

1096
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"but now I'm all alone."</i></font>

1097
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?</i></font>

1098
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.</i></font>

1099
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"But you know what? I'm Luis."</i></font>

1100
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,</i></font>

1101
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"and we're gonna be
best friends."</i></font>

1102
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, hold on, hold on.</font>

1103
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like a good story
as much as the next person...</font>

1104
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what in the hell
does this have to do</font>

1105
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with where Scott Lang is?</font>

1106
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.</font>

1107
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You put a dime in him,</font>

1108
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you gotta let the whole song
play out.</font>

1109
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He like human jukebox.</font>

1110
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox
in the restaurant!</font>

1111
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i></font>

1112
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i></font>

1113
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."</i></font>

1114
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, iadios!</font>

1115
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I say?
We relate to his</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">melancholy ballads,
you know?</font>

1117
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lang!
- Right, right, right.</font>

1118
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,</font>

1119
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he starts working
for Hank.</font>

1120
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i></font>

1121
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"I want nothing to do
with you.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."</i></font>

1123
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And then Scotty's, like,</i></font>

1124
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i></font>

never find love again,</i></font>

if I want to kiss you!"</i></font>

1127
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But then you fast forward</i></font>

1128
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and they're all
into each other, right?</i></font>

1129
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And then Scotty's, like,</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"You know what?
I can't tell you this...</i></font>

airport with Captain America."</i></font>

1132
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!</i></font>

1133
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Smell you later, dummy."</i></font>

1134
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Scotty goes
on house arrest.</font>

1135
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And he won't admit it,

1138
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,856

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's on me! That's on me!
- Hey!</font>

1155
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough.</font>

1156
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna ask you
one more time.</font>

1157
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Scott Lang?</font>

1158
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been trying to tell you,</font>

1159
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.</font>

1160
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Emotionally speaking.</font>

1161
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!</font>

1162
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!
The woods.</font>

1163
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The woods?</font>

1164
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baba Yaga!</font>

1165
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean, "the woods"?</font>

1166
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Muir Woods,
the second fire road</font>

1167
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">off the Panoramic Highway!</font>

1168
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For God's sake!</font>

1169
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Baba Yaga, come at night</i></font>

1170
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Little children, sleepy tight</i></font>

1171
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

1172
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that freak
gets Pym's tech...</font>

1173
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm never gonna see it.</font>

1174
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do we do now?</font>

1175
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's easier to steal it
from the Feds</font>

1176
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than from the boogeyman.</font>

1177
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?</font>

1178
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.</font>

1179
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,</font>

1180
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because they ain't gonna
be there for long.</font>

1181
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.</font>

1182
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understood.</font>

1183
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good news, gentlemen.</font>

1184
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.</font>

1185
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!</font>

1186
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

1187
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir.
- Can you knock?</font>

1188
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.</font>

1189
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, I love leads.</font>

1190
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">System's in the green.</font>

1191
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Priming the coils.</font>

1192
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Full charge.</font>

1193
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As soon
as the tunnel's open...</font>

1194
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let us know
if you get anything</font>

1195
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that could be a part of
her message.</font>

1196
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah. I will.</font>

1197
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, then.</font>

1198
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here it goes.</font>

1199
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did it!</font>

1200
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got anything?</font>

1201
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothin'.</font>

1202
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...</font>

1203
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1204
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no!</font>

1205
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening?</font>

1206
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.</font>

1207
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!</font>

1208
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what else
could it be?</font>

1209
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know!</font>

1210
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!</font>

1211
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott, you can't...</font>

1212
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.</font>

1213
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to fix the algorithm.</font>

1214
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me,
after 30 years down here...</font>

1215
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've thought about it a lot.</font>

1216
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet?</font>

1217
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, honey.</font>

1218
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jellybean.</font>

1219
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom?</font>

1220
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.</font>

1221
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all so rushed.</font>

1222
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two have done
such great work.</font>

1223
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just need a little...</font>

1224
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nudge.</font>

1225
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet,
how is this possible?</font>

1226
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't a message you put</font>

1227
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.</font>

1228
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clever girl.</font>

1229
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so proud of you.</font>

1230
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, tell us where you are.</font>

1231
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell us how to find you.</font>

1232
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, the probability fields
are too complex.</font>

1233
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I needed
to talk to you.</font>

1234
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to follow my voice.</font>

1235
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course!</font>

1236
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like tracing a call
back to its source!</font>

1237
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...</font>

1238
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between point 2
and point 9.</font>

1239
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd narrow it to 4 and 6.</font>

1240
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's too tight.
We could miss you.</font>

1241
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at us squabbling again.</font>

1242
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine. All right,
between 3 and 7.</font>

1243
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.</font>

1244
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bullseye.</font>

1245
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Source lock.</font>

1246
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's you.</font>

1247
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got it!</font>

1248
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.</font>

1249
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.</font>

1250
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's very dangerous,</font>

1251
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">especially on the human mind,
so be careful.</font>

1252
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time and space work very
differently down here.</font>

1253
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have 2 hours.</font>

1254
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After that, the probability
fields will shift...</font>

1255
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it'll be another century</font>

1256
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before they align
like this again.</font>

1257
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll find you.</font>

1258
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you will, Jellybean.</font>

1259
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

1260
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.</font>

1261
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect.</font>

1262
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did we get up here?</font>

1263
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...</font>

1264
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's gonna get
really trippy...</font>

1265
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.</font>

1266
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott, I'll be fine.</font>

1267
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying
because I've been down there.</font>

1268
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, so you've mentioned.</font>

1269
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, sorry.
I have to take this.</font>

1270
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hey, man, you coming?</i></font>

1271
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.</font>

1272
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.</font>

1273
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</font>

1274
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.</font>

1275
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then all of a sudden</font>

1276
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I started talkin'
all honestly.</font>

1277
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.</font>

1278
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I hate it, I hate it.</i></font>

1279
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh...
- But you need to go home...</font>

1280
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the Feds
are probably going there now!</font>

1281
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And by the way...</font>

1282
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!</font>

1283
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like such a jerk.</font>

1284
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.</font>

1285
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1286
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.</font>

1287
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

1288
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?</font>

1289
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told him to come here
so I could help him</font>

1290
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the Karapetyan proposal.</font>

1291
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

1292
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we need
to land that account.</font>

1293
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise,
we lose the business!</font>

1294
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons</font>

1295
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to find work these days?</font>

1296
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Scott!</font>

1297
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">90 seconds to close
the aperture!</font>

1298
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to depolarize
the coils first!</font>

1299
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know!</font>

1300
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really sorry...</font>

1301
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the, um, FBI
is coming to my place so...</font>

1302
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go.</font>

1303
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I borrow the suit?</font>

1304
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i></font>

1305
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Powering on.</i></font>

1306
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna borrow
the suit.</font>

1307
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.</font>

1308
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't bother.
- What?</font>

1309
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll come
and get the suit from you,</font>

1310
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as soon as we've found my mom.</font>

1311
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hope...
- Scott, just go!</font>

1312
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Scott?
- Daddy?</font>

1313
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's us, buddy!</font>

1314
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here for Cassie's shoes!</font>

1315
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He must be resting.</font>

1316
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, why don't you
go upstairs</font>

1317
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and look under your bed?</font>

1318
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy, you upstairs?</font>

1319
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy?</font>

1320
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

1321
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He really lives
like a pig these days.</font>

1322
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy?</font>

1323
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spread out!</font>

1324
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again?</font>

1325
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You people have no shame!</font>

1326
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.</font>

1327
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm not buying it!</font>

1328
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie, let the man get by!</font>

1329
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Daddy's super sick!</font>

1330
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see about that!</font>

1331
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!</font>

1332
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take my chances, sweetie.</font>

1333
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He barfed. Like, a lot.</font>

1334
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young lady,
I'm a federal agent.</font>

1335
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen worse things
than vomit.</font>

1336
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, "a lot" a lot?</font>

1337
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes!
- Forget it, move aside!</font>

1338
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1339
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Woo!</font>

1340
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing here?
- Scott.</font>

1341
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,
I'm just really sick.</font>

1342
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you.</font>

1343
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1344
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?</font>

1345
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

1346
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll start the van.</font>

1347
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get the lab.</font>

1348
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze!
You're surrounded!</font>

1349
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank Pym...</font>

1350
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope Van Dyne...</font>

1351
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're under arrest.</font>

1352
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is harassment!</font>

1353
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, it's not.</font>

1354
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does the FBI
even stand for...</font>

1355
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Forever
Bothering Individuals"?</font>

1356
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- His monitor check out?
- Of course it does.</font>

1357
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

1358
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.</font>

1359
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.</font>

1360
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously? Yes!</font>

1361
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.</font>

1362
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're your friends.
That's insensitive.</font>

1363
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just really needed a win,
you know?</font>

1364
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, I'll be back later</font>

1365
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the official end
of your sentence!</font>

1366
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry for misjudging you, pal!</font>

1367
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should feel great
about yourself!</font>

1368
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:56,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1369
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a man down.</font>

1370
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Pym's lab is gone.</font>

1371
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1372
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for covering for me.</font>

1373
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1374
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

1375
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how long
have you been Ant-Man again?</font>

1376
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not long.</font>

1377
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just sort of happened.</font>

1378
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry for lying to you...</font>

1379
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm sorry
for risking everything.</font>

1380
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy, it's okay.</font>

1381
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not.</font>

1382
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do some dumb things...</font>

1383
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the people that I love
the most pay the price.</font>

1384
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mainly you.</font>

1385
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to help people
isn't dumb.</font>

1386
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I screw it up
just about every time.</font>

1387
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...</font>

1388
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like a partner.</font>

1389
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she's made it clear</font>

1390
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's about the last thing
she wants.</font>

1391
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

1392
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope.</font>

1393
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, who did you think?</font>

1394
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

1395
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You?</font>

1396
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't laugh.</font>

1397
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be a great partner.</font>

1398
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, peanut.</font>

1399
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...</font>

1400
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would be a terrible dad.</font>

1401
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

1402
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.</font>

1403
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She reminds me of you.</font>

1404
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna go help her?</font>

1405
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you should help her.</font>

1406
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I could...</font>

1407
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.</font>

1408
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do it.</font>

1409
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do anything.</font>

1410
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the world's
greatest grandma.</font>

1411
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.</font>

1412
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An hour?
We don't have an hour.</font>

1413
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?</font>

1414
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, now, that's my girl.</font>

1415
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, what's our plan?</font>

1416
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To shrink that wall.</font>

1417
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks load-bearing.</font>

1418
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ceiling could collapse.</font>

1419
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we run like hell.</font>

1420
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.</font>

1421
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roughly 5 times that
in the building at large.</font>

1422
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all heavily armed.</font>

1423
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not great odds.</font>

1424
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got any better ideas?</font>

1425
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

1426
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not giving up on Mom.</font>

1427
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'd be so proud of you.</font>

1428
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1429
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One...</font>

1430
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">two...</font>

1431
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott?</font>

1432
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you two
just standing around for?</font>

1433
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta go find that lab.</font>

1434
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about me?</font>

1435
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect.</font>

1436
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.</font>

1437
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, now what?</font>

1438
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're asking me?</font>

1439
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in!</font>

1440
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1441
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1442
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...</font>

1443
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...</font>

1444
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until they start shooting
at us?</font>

1445
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1446
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Burch.
- Yeah.</font>

1447
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, they're out.</font>

1448
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm on my way.</i></font>

1449
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.</font>

1450
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could this happen?</font>

1451
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, what the dickens?</font>

1452
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1453
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

1454
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, uh, how do we find
the lab?</font>

1455
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After we lost it
the first time...</font>

1456
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I put on a new tracker...</font>

1457
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of sorts.</font>

1458
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'll work.</font>

1459
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it ready or not?</font>

1460
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can begin
the extraction process.</font>

1461
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Ava.</font>

1462
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This whole thing
could be very dangerous.</font>

1463
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should...</font>

1464
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should what? Wait?</font>

1465
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got days until I'm dead.</font>

1466
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're doing this, Bill. Now.</font>

1467
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.</font>

1468
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:24,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have much time before</font>

1469
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.</font>

1470
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.</font>

1471
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
my pep-pep always said,</font>

1472
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."</font>

1473
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we should do that.</font>

1474
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One, we have to break
into that lab.</font>

1475
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.</font>

1476
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.</font>

1477
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?</font>

1478
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's call it 2-A.</font>

1479
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fight Ghost. 2-A.</font>

1480
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab</font>

1481
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is fully grown
for you to come back.</font>

1482
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, we're screwed.</font>

1483
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott!</font>

1484
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to start again?
I'll start again...</font>

1485
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to dive.</font>

1486
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...</font>

1487
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">together,
protecting the tunnel.</font>

1488
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me do this, Hope. Please.</font>

1489
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me get her.</font>

1490
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he's right.</font>

1491
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Whassup?"</font>

1492
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?</font>

1493
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Whassup?"</font>

1494
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had him follow us.</font>

1495
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:33,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we could use
some help.</font>

1496
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
I'm in position.</font>

1497
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ants are headed in.</font>

1498
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Copy that.</i></font>

1499
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Keep your eyes peeled,
Scotty.</i></font>

1500
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you want Pez?
- No.</font>

1501
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.</font>

1502
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, I love that suit!</font>

1503
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, man.</font>

1504
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I had a suit.</font>

1505
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?</font>

1506
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.</font>

1507
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1508
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't know.</font>

1509
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's them!</font>

1510
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can't be far.</font>

1511
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Hank. Hank?</font>

1512
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, what's your status?</font>

1513
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Foster's taken care of.</font>

1514
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suiting up now.</font>

1515
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted to save Ava.</font>

1516
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's facing death or
something far more terrible.</font>

1517
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's afraid.</font>

1518
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.</font>

1519
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise.</font>

1520
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Together, we'll figure
something out.</font>

1521
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, Hank.</font>

1522
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Bill.</font>

1523
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.</font>

1524
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hank's in, Scott.</i></font>

1526
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Any sign of her?</i></font>

1527
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, nothing yet.</font>

1528
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ava!</font>

1529
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call off the ants, Scott.</font>

1530
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy!</font>

1531
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get a status report?</font>

1532
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!</font>

1533
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,430

1534
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,192

- Don't.</font>

1535
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,954

1536
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I can't lose you, too.</i></font>

1537
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,795

1538
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys,
everything's bad over here.</font>

1539
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now.</font>

1540
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Misdirection.</font>

1541
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the first things
they teach you</font>

1542
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at Online Close-up
Magic University.</font>

1543
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1544
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!</font>

1545
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meet us
at the rendezvous point.</font>

1546
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, on my way!</font>

1547
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

1548
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?
This guy again?</font>

1549
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

1550
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you
our business wasn't over.</font>

1551
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change of plans.</font>

1552
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on.</font>

1553
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.</font>

1554

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

1555
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That undercarriage is filthy!</font>

1556
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, they got bigger problems.</font>

1557
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope, what're you doing?</font>

1558
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,216

1562
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!</font>

1563

1589
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got you now, Ava!</font>

1590
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Oh!</font>

1591
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not again!</font>

1592
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Piece of junk!</font>

1593
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah! Yes!</font>

1594
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go, go, go!</font>

1595
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burch got the lab.</font>

1596
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going after him.</font>

1597
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no,
no, no, no!</font>

1598
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,639

I'm coming, I'm coming!</font>

1602
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're running
out of time.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming to you, honey.</font>

1605
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys.</font>

1606
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you need the remote
to the lab? I just found it.</font>

1607
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't grow
the lab without it.</font>

1608
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it to us fast.</font>

1609
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but the van is busted.</font>

1610
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.</font>

1611
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1612
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Dr. Pym.</font>

1613
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The remote!
We're missing the remote!</font>

1614
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You gotta check the van!</i></font>

1615
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1616
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome!</font>

1617
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm going down Pacific.</font>

1618

1619
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:08,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on my way.</font>

1620
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. I'll get the lab.</font>

1621
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1622
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,156

1624
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doink!</font>

1625
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here, you little weasel!</font>

1626
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't!</font>

1627
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess maybe you do.</font>

1628
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1629
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?</font>

1630
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?</font>

1631
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you just one time,</font>

1632
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">please work!</font>

1633
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1634
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I need help.</font>

1635
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1636
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Sorry. Ah...</font>

1637
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody!</font>

1638
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Come on, man!</font>

1639
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not cool!</font>

1640
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Murderers!</font>

1641
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, yes, yes, yes!</font>

1642
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!</font>

1643
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a badass!</font>

1644
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1645
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

1646
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,633

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just meet me
at the waterfront.</font>

1653
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In 3 hours.</font>

1654

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...</i></font>

1655
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,758

we got some company.</i></font>

1656
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i></font>

1657
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There it is.
There's a breach.</i></font>

1658

1659
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Sorry. Hi.</font>

1660

1661
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.</font>

1662
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! That doesn't belong
to you!</font>

1663
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no! No, no!</font>

1664
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're embarrassing
yourself now.</font>

1665
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let go.</font>

1666
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1667

01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the remote, Luis?</font>

1735
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's probably in there.</font>

1736
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have it.
I don't have it.</font>

1737
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess
this is where we say...</font>

1738
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Adios, amigo.</i></font>

1739
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no!</font>

1740
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, guys.</font>

1741
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ava?</font>

1742
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ava!</font>

1743
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ava!</font>

1744
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Almost ready for extraction.</font>

1745
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!</font>

1746
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!</font>

1747
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if Hank is right?</font>

1748
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if this process
kills Janet?</font>

1749
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, you're worried
about her?</font>

1750
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.</font>

1751
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She may be able to help.</font>

1752
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, she will help. Right now!</font>

1753
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if she dies, she dies!</font>

1754
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.</font>

1755
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to find another way.</font>

1756
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the way.</font>

1757
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janet!</font>

1758
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She started
the extraction.</font>

1759
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gonna tear Mom apart.</font>

1760
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1761
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope!</font>

1762
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1763
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom?</font>

1764
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1765
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found you.</font>

1766
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed you so much.</font>

1767
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I missed you too, Jellybean.</font>

1768
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1769
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here now.
We have time.</font>

1770
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more last-minute
business trips, okay?</font>

1771
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise.</font>

1772
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's okay!</font>

1773
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.</font>

1774
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll be fine.
- Dad.</font>

1775
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott.</font>

1776
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Van Dyne.</font>

1777
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nice to...</font>

1778
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess
we've already met.</font>

1779
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I guess we have.</font>

1780
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

1781
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your pain.</font>

1782
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can feel it.</font>

1783
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It hurts.</font>

1784
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:20,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It always hurts.</font>

1785
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1786
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I can help you.</font>

1787
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know
she could do that?</font>

1788
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1789
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, the cops are coming!</font>

1790
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

1791
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!</font>

1792
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!</font>

1793
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:25,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about them?</font>

1794
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands in the air!</font>

1795
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No! We are going to our jobs.
- No.</font>

1796
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.</font>

1797
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:38,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.</font>

1798
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We traffic
in stolen technology.</font>

1799
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we have killed many,
many people.</font>

1800
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, he's in charge.</font>

1801
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's true, I am.</font>

1802
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've also committed</font>

1803
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.</font>

1804
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of them would shock you.</font>

1805
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is truth serum.</font>

1806
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get outta here.</font>

1807
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fast.</font>

1808
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an idea.</font>

1809
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:09,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Giant figure, now spotted</i></font>

1810
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.</i></font>

1811
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All units move in.</i></font>

1812
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go!</font>

1813
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There he is!</font>

1814
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over, Scotty!</font>

1815
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,
but we got you, man!</font>

1816
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.</font>

1817
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nowhere to hide.</font>

1818
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:35,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!</font>

1819
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!</font>

1820
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic.</font>

1821
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

1822
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to Lang's, now!</font>

1823
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:00,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done, honey.</font>

1824
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

1825
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave me here.</font>

1826
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can make it.</font>

1827
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said it yourself.</font>

1828
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've hurt people.</font>

1829
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:19,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you haven't.</font>

1830
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Please!</font>

1831
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can make it, Ava.</font>

1832
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bill...</font>

1833
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not leaving you.</font>

1834
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey, guys.</font>

1835
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are my 2 years up already?</font>

1836
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:23,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's it like out there?</font>

1837
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?</font>

1838
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are food trucks still a thing?</font>

1839
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...</font>

1840
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:33,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, uh,
I'll be seeing you again.</font>

1841
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:35,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where?</font>

1842
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:37,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1843
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where will you be
seeing me again?</font>

1844
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:43,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, in general...</font>

1845
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The next time
you do something bad,</font>

1846
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll be there to catch you...
- Oh.</font>

1847
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be watching...</font>

1848
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:51,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.</font>

1849
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I do that?</font>

1850
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?</font>

1851
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:58,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?</font>

1852
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.</font>

1853
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again."</font>

1854
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course,
that would be strange.</font>

1855
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- Okay.</font>

1856
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?</font>

1857
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, because I'm free...</font>

1858
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Come on.</font>

1859
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready?</font>

1860
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:22,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1861
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.</font>

1862
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:28,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1863
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?</font>

1864
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">X-Con Security.</font>

1865
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:35,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Karapetyan?</font>

1866
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you saw that?</font>

1867
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:42,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.</font>

1868
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.</font>

1869
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1870
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how you close a deal!</font>

1871
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is awesome.</font>

1872
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Cassie...</font>

1873
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what do you want to be
when you grow up?</font>

1874
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna help people...</font>

1875
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like my dad.</font>

1876
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1877
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to be his partner.</font>

1878
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he said he wants you.</font>

1879
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that so?</font>

1880
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,554

1881
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Hold on.</font>

1882
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, get outta here!</font>

1883
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott, don't, don't, don't!</font>

1884
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow.</font>

1885
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, gross!</font>

1886
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh. I hate that moth dust!</font>

1887
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:58,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Shoo! Shoo!</font>

1888
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to be
a respected scientist.</font>

1889
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:11,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had my name
on the sides of buildings.</font>

1890
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I got this.</font>

1891
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.</font>

1892
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:19,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is... smaller.</font>

1893
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:23,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Sorry. My bad.</font>

1894
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, I think it has flair.</font>

1895
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Control's online.</font>

1896
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.</font>

1897
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It should automatically
start absorbing</font>

1898
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">quantum healing particles.</font>

1899
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.</font>

1900
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're cute,
but they'll eat you.</font>

1901
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.</font>

1902
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We won't be able to save you.</font>

1903
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:50,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1904
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,154

1909
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:05,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.</font>

1910
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Mic check, 1, 2.

in the quantum realm?</i></font>

1912
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scott, we read you.</font>

1913
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanna
make sure.</font>

1914
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1915
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.</font>

1916

1919
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1920
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha, ha. Very funny.</font>

1921
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hank, quit screwing around.</font>

1922
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me yourself
not to screw around.</font>

1923
