00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:50,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On your left.</font>

2
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On your left.</font>

3
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:04,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh. On my left. Got it.</font>

4
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:11,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't say it. Don't you say it.</font>

5
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:12,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- On your left.
- Come on!</font>

6
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

7
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:23,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Need a medic?</font>

8
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a new set of lungs.</font>

9
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:31,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, you just ran,
like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.</font>

10
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I got a late start.</font>

11
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:35,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? You should
be ashamed of yourself.</font>

12
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should take another lap.</font>

13
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.</font>

14
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:41,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What unit you with?</font>

15
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">58th Pararescue.</font>

16
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:45,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now I'm working down at the VA.</font>

17
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.</font>

18
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:49,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I kind of put that together.</font>

19
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:53,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must have freaked you out, coming
home after the whole defrosting thing.</font>

20
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It takes some getting used to.</font>

21
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good to meet you, Sam.</font>

22
00:01:57,853 --> 00:01:58,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your bed, right?</font>

23
00:02:00,093 --> 00:02:01,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

24
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:02,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your bed, it's too soft.</font>

25
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:04,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,</font>

26
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">use rock for pillows, like a caveman.</font>

27
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:09,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm home, lying in my bed,
and it's like...</font>

28
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lying on a marshmallow.</font>

29
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.</font>

30
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:15,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long?</font>

31
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:16,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two tours.</font>

32
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must miss the good old days, huh?</font>

33
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:22,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, things aren't so bad.</font>

34
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Food's a lot better.
We used to boil everything.</font>

35
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:26,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No polio is good.</font>

36
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Internet, so helpful.</font>

37
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:30,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been reading that a lot,
trying to catch up.</font>

38
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:35,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marvin Gaye, 1972,
Trouble Man soundtrack.</i></font>

39
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:38,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything you missed
jammed into one album.</font>

40
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll put it on the list.</font>

41
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.</font>

42
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that's what you want to call running.</font>

43
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's how it is?</font>

44
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, that's how it is.
- Okay.</font>

45
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:58,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any time you want to stop by the VA,
make me look awesome</font>

46
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in front of the girl at the front desk,
just let me know.</font>

47
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.</font>

48
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:09,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, fellas.</font>

49
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either one of you
know where the Smithsonian is?</font>

50
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to pick up a fossil.</font>

51
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:14,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's hilarious.</font>

52
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How you doing?
- Hey.</font>

53
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:23,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't run everywhere.</font>

54
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:24,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you can't.</font>

55
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,</font>

56
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:35,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>the Lemurian Star.</i></font>

57
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were sending up their last payload
when pirates took them,</font>

58
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:39,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">93 minutes ago.</font>

59
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.</font>

60
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:44,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.</font>

61
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.</font>

62
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure they have a good reason.</font>

63
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:51,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.</font>

64
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:53,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. It's not that complicated.</font>

65
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many pirates?</font>

66
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">25. Top mercs led by this guy.</font>

67
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:01,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Georges Batroc.
Ex-DGSE, Action Division.</font>

68
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.</font>

69
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before the French demobilised him,
he had 36 kill missions.</font>

70
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:09,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy's got a rep
for maximum casualties.</font>

71
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:10,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hostages?</font>

72
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.</font>

73
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're in the galley.</font>

74
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:17,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?</font>

75
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I'm gonna
sweep the deck and find Batroc.</font>

76
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.</font>

77
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:24,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,</font>

78
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">get them to the life-pods, get them out.
Let's move.</font>

79
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:27,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap.
Gear up.</font>

80
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:42,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secure channel 7.</font>

81
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:43,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">7 secure.</font>

82
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:45,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you do anything fun
Saturday night?</font>

83
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, all the guys
from my barbershop quartet are dead,</font>

84
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:50,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so, no, not really.</font>

85
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:53,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i></font>

86
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:56,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, if you ask Kristen out,
from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.</font>

87
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I don't ask.</font>

88
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too shy, or too scared?</font>

89
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too busy!</font>

90
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:06,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was he wearing a parachute?</font>

91
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

92
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:09,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he wasn't.</font>

93
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:11,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

94
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:19,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

95
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

96
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:05,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>

97
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:10,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

98
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.</font>

99
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the nurse that
lives across the hall from you?</font>

100
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:19,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She seems kind of nice.</font>

101
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.</font>

102
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm multi-tasking.</font>

103
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:25,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told Batroc...</font>

104
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...</font>

105
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:29,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...start sending them bodies now!</font>

106
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:33,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a bullet for someone...</font>

107
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:36,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want a bullet in your head?</font>

108
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move that foot you want
a bullet in the head?</font>

109
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:39,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

110
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:49,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like waiting.</font>

111
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:51,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call Durand.</font>

112
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:55,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.</font>

113
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start the engines.</font>

114
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

115
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sailor.</font>

116
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:28,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up.</font>

117
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:32,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to be a hero? Is that it?</font>

118
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I've waited long enough...</font>

119
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:45,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

120
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:46,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find Batroc...</font>

121
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,694

122
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:49,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...I start killing them!</font>

123
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:50,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find him.</font>

124
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2 minutes.</font>

125
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,980

129
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:46,974

134
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You!</font>

135
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:21,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get that one.</font>

136
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my mark.</font>

137

139
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:38,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you,
S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.</font>

140
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The line just went dead.</font>

141
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:45,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lost contact with them...</font>

142

and protect the hostages.</font>

148
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natasha.</font>

149
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you were
more than just a shield...</font>

150
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:07,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see.</font>

151
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is awkward.</font>

152
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:39,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

153
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:41,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Backing up the hard drive.</font>

154
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:42,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good habit to get into.</font>

155
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:44,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rumlow needed your help.</font>

156
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:45,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you doing here?</font>

157
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.</font>

158
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:51,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever I can get my hands on.</font>

159
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our mission is to rescue hostages.</font>

160
00:12:53,613 --> 00:12:55,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's your mission,</font>

161
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:58,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you've done it beautifully.</font>

162
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just jeopardised
this whole operation.</font>

163
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that's overstating things.</font>

164
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:21,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

165
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:23,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one's on me.</font>

166
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:26,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're damn right.</font>

167
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:57,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?</font>

168
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't lie.</font>

169
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent Romanoff
had a different mission than yours.</font>

170
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which you didn't feel obliged to share.</font>

171
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:03,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not obliged to do anything.</font>

172
00:14:03,573 --> 00:14:05,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those hostages could have died, Nick.</font>

173
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:08,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.</font>

174
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.</font>

175
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a bunch of guys
running around shooting guns.</font>

176
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:16,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last time I trusted someone,
I lost an eye.</font>

177
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:20,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I didn't want you doing
anything you weren't comfortable with.</font>

178
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:22,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.</font>

179
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:24,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't lead a mission</font>

180
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.</font>

181
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:29,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called compartmentalisation.</font>

182
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:31,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.</font>

183
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:33,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except you.</font>

184
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:39,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wrong about me.</font>

185
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:41,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do share.</font>

186
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:43,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm nice like that.</font>

187
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:46,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Insight bay.</font>

188
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:48,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Captain Rogers does not have</i></font>

189
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>clearance for Project Insight.</i></font>

190
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:52,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.</font>

191
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:53,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Confirmed.</i></font>

192
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:58,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, they used to play music.</font>

193
00:14:58,973 --> 00:14:59,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

194
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.</font>

195
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granddad worked in a nice building.</font>

196
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:07,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got good tips.</font>

197
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:12,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd walk home every night,
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.</font>

198
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:13,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd say, "Hi."</font>

199
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People would say, "Hi" back.</font>

200
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:19,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time went on,
the neighbourhood got rougher.</font>

201
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd say, "Hi."</font>

202
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."</font>

203
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:25,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.</font>

204
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:26,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he ever get mugged?</font>

205
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every week some punk would say,
"What's in the bag?"</font>

206
00:15:32,173 --> 00:15:33,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would he do?</font>

207
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd show them.</font>

208
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:39,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.</font>

209
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Granddad loved people.</font>

210
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he didn't trust them very much.</font>

211
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know.</font>

212
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're a little bit bigger than a .22.</font>

213
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Project Insight.</font>

214
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:37,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three next-generation helicarriers</font>

215
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:40,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">synced to a network
of targeting satellites.</font>

216
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Launched from the Lemurian Star.</i></font>

217
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:45,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.</font>

218
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:50,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.</font>

219
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:52,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stark?</font>

220
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a few suggestions</font>

221
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">once he got an up-close look
at our old turbines.</font>

222
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:59,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These new long-range precision guns</font>

223
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.</font>

224
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:06,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.</font>

225
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:09,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna neutralise a lot of threats
before they even happen.</font>

226
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:11,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought the punishment
usually came after the crime.</font>

227
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't afford to wait that long.</font>

228
00:17:13,253 --> 00:17:14,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's "we"?</font>

229
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council</font>

230
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.</font>

231
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For once, we're way ahead of the curve.</font>

232
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By holding a gun to everyone on Earth
and calling it protection.</font>

233
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I read those SSR files.</font>

234
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:31,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Greatest Generation"?</font>

235
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys did some nasty stuff.</font>

236
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:36,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we compromised.</font>

237
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.</font>

238
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we did it
so that people could be free.</font>

239
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:43,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't freedom. This is fear.</font>

240
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:47,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is,
not as we'd like it to be.</font>

241
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:51,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that Programme, Cap.</font>

242
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't hold your breath.</font>

proud of yourself, Peggy.</font>

274
00:20:24,813 --> 00:20:26,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

275
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:29,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have lived a life.</font>

276
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:34,422

you didn't get to live yours.</font>

277
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

278
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:44,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.</font>

00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is any more.</font>

280
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:55,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I thought I could
throw myself back in and follow orders.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just not the same.</font>

283
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're always so dramatic.</font>

284
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you saved the world.</font>

285
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:17,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We rather mucked it up.</font>

286
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:19,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't.</font>

287
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:23,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

289
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:32,737

we can do is to start over.</font>

297
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:05,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Peggy.</font>

298

299

315
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:18,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This failure is unacceptable.</font>

316
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:20,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Considering this attack took place</font>

317
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:22,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one mile from my country's

318
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:24,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.</font>

319
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need hearings,
we need action.</font>

00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:29,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

321
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A breach like this
raises serious questions.</font>

322
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like how the hell did a French pirate</font>

323
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:37,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?</font>

324
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:39,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.</font>

325
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:42,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can draw a map if it'd help.</font>

326
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:45,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.</font>

327
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:48,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this Council takes things
like international piracy fairly seriously.</font>

328
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:52,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? I don't.</font>

329
00:23:53,773 --> 00:23:56,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.</font>

330
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:00,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If this Council is going to fall to rancour</font>

331
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every time someone pushes us
on the playing field,</font>

332
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:06,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe we need someone to oversee us.</font>

333
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:09,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Secretary,
nobody is suggesting...</font>

334
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:14,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

335
00:24:14,213 --> 00:24:15,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More trouble, Mr. Secretary?</font>

336
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:17,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Depends on your definition.</font>

337
00:24:26,373 --> 00:24:29,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I work 40 floors away
and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?</font>

338
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:31,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A nuclear war would do it, too.</font>

339
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:34,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You busy in there?</font>

340
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing some earmarks can't fix.</font>

341
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:41,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to ask a favour.</font>

342
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:43,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to call for a vote.</font>

343
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:46,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Project Insight has to be delayed.</font>

344
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:48,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick, that's not a favour,</font>

345
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's a sub-committee hearing.
A long one.</font>

346
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.</font>

347
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:55,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need time
to make sure it's nothing.</font>

348
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if it's something?</font>

349
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we'll both be damn glad
those helicarriers aren't in the air.</font>

350
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:02,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

351
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:06,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you got to get Iron Man
to stop by my niece's birthday party.</font>

352
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

353
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:11,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.</font>

354
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:15,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The thing is,</i></font>

355
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's getting worse.</font>

356
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A cop pulled me over last week.</font>

357
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He thought I was drunk.</font>

358
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:27,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swerved to miss a plastic bag.</font>

359
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it was an IED.</font>

360
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:35,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some stuff you leave there.</font>

361
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:37,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other stuff you bring back.</font>

362
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:40,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's our job to figure out how to carry it.</font>

363
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:44,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?</font>

364
00:25:46,053 --> 00:25:47,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's up to you.</font>

365
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:49,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.</font>

366
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:53,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who it is, the running man.</font>

367
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.</font>

368
00:25:57,493 --> 00:26:00,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, brother,
we all got the same problems.</font>

369

371
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:06,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lose someone?</font>

372
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:09,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wingman, Riley.</font>

373

375

1,000 times before.</font>

376

dumb ass out of the sky.</font>

377
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:23,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing I could do.</font>

378
00:26:23,893 --> 00:26:25,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like I was up there just to watch.</font>

379
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry.
- After that,</font>

380
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:32,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a really hard time finding a reason
for being over there, you know?</font>

00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:36,974

00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:45,173

00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:22,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Calculating route to secure location.</i></font>

437
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:40,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sweet. That is so nice.</font>

438
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:42,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

439
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to go, though.</font>

440
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:45,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Bye.</font>

441
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.</font>

442
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:51,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

443
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, if you want...</font>

444
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:56,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want,
you're welcome to use my machine.</font>

445
00:33:56,653 --> 00:33:58,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Might be cheaper
than the one in the basement.</font>

446
00:33:59,093 --> 00:34:00,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah? What's it cost?</font>

447
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:03,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A cup of coffee?</font>

448
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, but</font>

449
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I already have a load in downstairs,</font>

450
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:12,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.</font>

451
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just finished a rotation
in the infectious disease ward, so...</font>

452
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll keep my distance.</font>

453
00:34:18,493 --> 00:34:19,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hopefully, not too far.</font>

454
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:24,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.</font>

455
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:25,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

456
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Thank you.</font>

457
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:28,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

458
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:16,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember giving you a key.</font>

459
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really think I'd need one?</font>

460
00:35:22,013 --> 00:35:23,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife kicked me out.</font>

461
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:26,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you were married.</font>

462
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of things you don't know about me.</font>

463
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:32,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, Nick. That's the problem.</font>

464
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:51,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.</font>

465
00:35:58,253 --> 00:35:59,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else knows about your wife?</font>

466
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:03,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just...</font>

467
00:36:06,093 --> 00:36:07,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends.</font>

468
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what we are?</font>

469
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's up to you.</font>

470
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:13,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

471
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:33,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't trust anyone.</font>

472
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:37,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Rogers?</font>

473
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:40,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain,</font>

474
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:43,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D.

475
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:44,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kate?</font>

476
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:47,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm assigned to protect you.</font>

477
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On whose order?</font>

478
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:50,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His.</font>

479
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:57,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.</font>

480
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:58,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need EMTs.</font>

481
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do we have a 20 on the shooter?</i></font>

482
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:02,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell him I'm in pursuit.</font>

483
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:04,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he gonna make it?</font>

484
00:38:04,173 --> 00:38:05,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

485
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me about the shooter.</font>

486
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:11,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's fast. Strong.</font>

487
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:15,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had a metal arm.</font>

488
00:38:20,573 --> 00:38:21,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ballistics?</font>

489
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:25,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three slugs, no rifling.
Completely untraceable.</font>

490
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:27,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soviet-made.</font>

491
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:29,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

492
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:31,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's in V-tach.</font>

493
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:32,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crash cart coming in.</font>

494
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:33,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nurse, help me with the drape.</font>

495
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">BP's dropping.
Defibrillator!</font>

496
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to charge him at 100.</font>

497
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do this to me, Nick.</font>

498
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:42,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand back.</font>

499
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:43,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three, two,</font>

500
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:45,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one. Clear.</font>

501
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:48,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pulse?
No pulse.</font>

502
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:49,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, 200, please.</font>

503
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:50,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand back!</font>

504
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:53,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three, two, one. Clear!</font>

505
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:54,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me epinephrine!</font>

506
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:56,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pulse?</font>

507
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:57,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative.</font>

508
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.</font>

509
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:23,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the time?</font>

510
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:25,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1:03, Doctor.</font>

511
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:29,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time of death, 1:03 a.m.</font>

512
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to take him.</font>

513
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:24,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natasha.</font>

514
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:38,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natasha!</font>

515
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:41,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why was Fury in your apartment?</font>

516
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

517
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

518
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:48,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, give me a second.</font>

519
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:49,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want you now.</font>

520
00:40:50,813 --> 00:40:52,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

521
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:57,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a terrible liar.</font>

522
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:05,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>S.T.R.I.K.E.
team, escort Captain Rogers</i></font>

523
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:07,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>back to S. H. I.E. L.D.
immediately for questioning.</i></font>

524
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:09,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told him.</font>

525
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:17,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go.
- Yeah.</font>

526
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:20,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.</font>

527
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:37,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Rogers.</font>

528
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:39,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neighbour.</font>

529
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:42,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Captain.</font>

530
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Alexander Pierce.</font>

531
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:46,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, it's an Honour.</font>

532
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:47,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The honour's mine, Captain.</font>

533
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father served in the 101st.
Come on in.</font>

534
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That photo was taken
5 years after Nick and I met,</font>

535
00:41:54,253 --> 00:41:56,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I was at State Department
in Bogota.</font>

536
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:59,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,</font>

537
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:03,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and security got me out,
but the rebels took hostages.</font>

538
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:07,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick was Deputy Chief
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,</font>

539
00:42:07,573 --> 00:42:08,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he comes to me with a plan.</font>

540
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wants to storm the building
through the sewers.</font>

541
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:13,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, "No, we'll negotiate."</font>

542
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:18,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.</font>

543
00:42:18,693 --> 00:42:20,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?</font>

544
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:22,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They find it empty.</font>

545
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:25,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick had ignored my direct order,</font>

546
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:29,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and carried out an unauthorised
military operation on foreign soil,</font>

547
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and saved the lives of
a dozen political officers,</font>

548
00:42:32,173 --> 00:42:33,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">including my daughter.</font>

549
00:42:33,453 --> 00:42:35,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you gave him a promotion.</font>

550
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:36,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never had any cause to regret it.</font>

551
00:42:39,013 --> 00:42:41,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain, why was Nick
in your apartment last night?</font>

552
00:42:45,173 --> 00:42:46,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

553
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:48,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know it was bugged?</font>

554
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did, because Nick told me.</font>

555
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:55,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he tell you
he was the one who bugged it?</font>

556
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:02,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to see something.</font>

557
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:05,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i></font>

558
00:43:05,493 --> 00:43:06,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that live?</font>

559
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:10,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.</font>

560
00:43:11,293 --> 00:43:12,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you saying he's a suspect?</font>

561
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:14,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Assassination isn't Batroc's line.</font>

562
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.
It's more complicated than that.</font>

563
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:20,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.</i></font>

564
00:43:20,453 --> 00:43:23,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,</font>

565
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:28,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then the money was run through
17 fictitious accounts.</font>

566
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last one going to
a holding company</font>

567
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was registered to a Jacob Veech.</font>

568
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:34,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I supposed to know who that is?</font>

569
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not likely. Veech died 6 years ago.</font>

570
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:40,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.</font>

571
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:44,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.</font>

572
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:49,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you saying
Fury hired the pirates? Why?</font>

573
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The prevailing theory</font>

574
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition</font>

575
00:43:55,493 --> 00:43:57,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and sale of classified intelligence.</font>

576
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:02,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sale went sour
and that led to Nick's death.</font>

577
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:08,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.</font>

578
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:11,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think we're talking?</font>

579
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:17,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,</font>

580
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:21,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.</font>

581
00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:27,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,</font>

582
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to build a really better world</font>

583
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:34,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sometimes means having
to tear the old one down.</font>

584
00:44:37,013 --> 00:44:38,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that makes enemies.</font>

585
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:43,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those people that call you dirty
because you got the guts</font>

586
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:46,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to stick your hands in the mud
and try to build something better.</font>

587
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:50,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the idea that those people
could be happy today</font>

588
00:44:52,133 --> 00:44:54,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">makes me really, really angry.</font>

589
00:44:58,653 --> 00:45:00,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.</font>

590
00:45:00,933 --> 00:45:02,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think that's an accident.</font>

591
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't think you do, either.</font>

592
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm gonna ask again.</font>

593
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why was he there?</font>

594
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He told me not to trust anyone.</font>

595
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:21,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder if that included him.</font>

596
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

597
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:28,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those were his last words.</font>

598
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:31,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

599
00:45:34,853 --> 00:45:36,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain,</font>

600
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:39,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.</font>

601
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:42,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.</font>

602
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone.</font>

603
00:45:48,653 --> 00:45:50,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understood.</font>

604
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:09,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Operations Control.</font>

605
00:46:09,253 --> 00:46:10,618

607
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:15,664

on the roof they want us to see.</font>

612
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:33,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to get the Tac team ready?</font>

613
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, let's wait and see what it is first.</font>

614
00:46:35,853 --> 00:46:36,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

615
00:46:48,693 --> 00:46:50,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the status so far?</font>

616
00:46:51,693 --> 00:46:53,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Administrations level.

617
00:46:53,893 --> 00:46:55,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

618
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:05,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about
what happened with Fury.</font>

619
00:47:06,053 --> 00:47:08,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's messed up, what happened to him.</font>

620
00:47:08,213 --> 00:47:09,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

621
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:29,540

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before we get started,</font>

624
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:51,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">does anyone want to get out?</font>

625
00:48:25,413 --> 00:48:27,177

626
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:43,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, big guy.</font>

627
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:47,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want you to know, Cap,
this isn't personal!</font>

628
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:00,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It kind of feels personal.</font>

629
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:11,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop the shield
and put your hands in the air!</font>

630
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:30,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!</font>

631
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have nowhere to go!</font>

632
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:53,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me?</font>

633
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:55,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.</font>

638
00:50:53,453 --> 00:50:54,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Level One.</font>

639
00:50:54,973 --> 00:50:56,702

647
00:51:12,613 --> 00:51:13,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If someone tweets about this guy,</font>

648
00:51:14,013 --> 00:51:15,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know about it.</font>

649
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:17,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With all due respect,
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting</font>

650
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.</font>

651
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:22,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he lied to us.</font>

652
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:27,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.</font>

653
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:29,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He refused to share it.</font>

654
00:51:30,493 --> 00:51:32,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As difficult as this is to accept,</font>

655
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:36,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain America is a fugitive
from S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

656
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:05,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is it?
- Safe.</font>

657
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:07,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do better.
- Where did you get it?</font>

658
00:52:07,613 --> 00:52:08,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I tell you?</font>

659
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:11,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fury gave it to you. Why?</font>

660
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:12,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's on it?
- I don't know.</font>

661
00:52:12,893 --> 00:52:13,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop lying.</font>

662
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:15,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only act like
I know everything, Rogers.</font>

663
00:52:17,013 --> 00:52:18,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?</font>

664
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:22,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.</font>

665
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna ask you again.</font>

666
00:52:26,253 --> 00:52:27,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who killed Fury.</font>

667
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:33,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.</font>

668
00:52:34,093 --> 00:52:36,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ones that do
call him the Winter Soldier.</font>

669
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:39,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations</font>

670
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the last 50 years.</font>

671
00:52:41,693 --> 00:52:43,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he's a ghost story.</font>

672
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:46,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.</font>

673
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:49,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody shot out
my tyres near Odessa.</font>

674
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We lost control,
went straight over a cliff.</font>

675
00:52:51,813 --> 00:52:53,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pulled us out.</font>

676
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:55,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the Winter Soldier was there.</font>

677
00:52:55,933 --> 00:52:58,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was covering my engineer
so he shot him</font>

678
00:52:58,573 --> 00:52:59,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">straight through me.</font>

679
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:01,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soviet slug.</font>

680
00:53:02,093 --> 00:53:04,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.</font>

681
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:08,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I bet you look terrible
in them now.</font>

682
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:13,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.</font>

683
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:16,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you said, he's a ghost story.</font>

684
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:23,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.</font>

685
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.</i></font>

686
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To any reasonable person,</font>

687
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that would make him a martyr,
not a traitor.</font>

688
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:31,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what makes him a traitor?</font>

689
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:34,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiring a mercenary
to hijack his own ship.</font>

690
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:36,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick Fury used your friendship</font>

691
00:53:37,093 --> 00:53:40,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to coerce this Council
into delaying Project Insight.</font>

692
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:42,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.</font>

693
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:45,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At best, he lied to you. At worst...</font>

694
00:53:46,053 --> 00:53:48,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you calling for my resignation?</font>

695
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:50,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got a pen and paper right here.</font>

696
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:52,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That discussion can be tabled
for a later time.</font>

697
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:55,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you do want to have a discussion?</font>

698
00:53:55,613 --> 00:53:57,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've already had it, Mr. Secretary.</font>

699
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:03,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Council moves to
immediately reactivate Project Insight.</font>

700
00:54:04,293 --> 00:54:07,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want to say something snappy,
now would be a good time.</font>

701
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:17,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First rule of going on the run
is don't run, walk.</font>

702
00:54:17,813 --> 00:54:20,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.</font>

703
00:54:23,173 --> 00:54:25,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The drive has a Level 6 homing
program, so as soon as we boot up</font>

704
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:27,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.</font>

705
00:54:27,773 --> 00:54:28,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much time will we have?</font>

706
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:31,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About 9 minutes from</font>

707
00:54:33,133 --> 00:54:34,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now.</font>

708
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:41,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fury was right about that ship.</font>

709
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody's trying to hide something.</font>

710
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.</font>

711
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:48,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.</font>

712
00:54:48,373 --> 00:54:50,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you override it?</font>

713
00:54:50,773 --> 00:54:53,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.</font>

714
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slightly.</font>

715
00:55:05,373 --> 00:55:06,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna try running a tracer.</font>

716
00:55:07,693 --> 00:55:09,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a program
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed</font>

717
00:55:09,493 --> 00:55:10,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to track hostile malware,</font>

718
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:13,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so if we can't read the file,</font>

719
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:15,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe we can find out
where it came from.</font>

720
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you guys with anything?</font>

721
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:21,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. My fiance was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.</font>

722
00:55:21,773 --> 00:55:23,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. We're getting married.</font>

723
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:26,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations. Where are
you guys thinking about going?</font>

724
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- New Jersey.
- Oh.</font>

725
00:55:34,173 --> 00:55:35,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have the exact same glasses.</font>

726
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you two are practically twins.</font>

727
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:40,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I wish.</font>

728
00:55:40,573 --> 00:55:41,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Specimen.</font>

729
00:55:42,253 --> 00:55:44,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.</font>

730
00:55:44,413 --> 00:55:45,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

731
00:55:47,893 --> 00:55:50,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You said 9 minutes. Come on.
- Relax.</font>

732
00:55:51,493 --> 00:55:52,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>

733
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:57,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it?</font>

734
00:55:57,893 --> 00:55:59,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to. Let's go.</font>

735
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:02,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Standard Tac team.</font>

736
00:56:03,053 --> 00:56:04,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two behind, two across,</font>

737
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:06,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and two coming straight at us.</font>

738
00:56:06,373 --> 00:56:09,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they make us, I'll engage,
you hit the south escalator to the metro.</font>

739
00:56:09,253 --> 00:56:11,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.</font>

740
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Do it.</font>

741
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:21,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative at the source.</font>

742
00:56:22,093 --> 00:56:23,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a floor rundown.</font>

743
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:24,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Negative on three.</i></font>

744
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Negative on two.</i></font>

745
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:28,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.</font>

746
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:37,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kiss me.
- What?</font>

747
00:56:38,013 --> 00:56:40,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Public displays of affection
make people very uncomfortable.</font>

748
00:56:40,213 --> 00:56:41,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, they do.</font>

749
00:56:50,813 --> 00:56:52,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still uncomfortable?</font>

750
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:54,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not exactly the word I would use.</font>

751
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:06,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?</font>

752
00:57:07,013 --> 00:57:08,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nazi Germany.
- Mmm.</font>

753
00:57:08,973 --> 00:57:11,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.</font>

754
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:18,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.</font>

755
00:57:19,053 --> 00:57:20,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like, if you don't answer it though,</font>

756
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:21,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?</font>

757
00:57:22,053 --> 00:57:24,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that your first kiss since 1945?</font>

758
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:26,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.</font>

759
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:28,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.</font>

760
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:29,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I didn't.</font>

761
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wondered
how much practice you've had.</font>

762
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:33,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.</font>

763
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was not my first kiss since 1945.</font>

764
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:37,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm 95, I'm not dead.</font>

765
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody special, though?</font>

766
00:57:42,173 --> 00:57:43,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Believe it or not, it's kind of hard</font>

767
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to find someone with
shared life experience.</font>

768
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.</font>

769
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:49,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What, like you?
- I don't know.</font>

770
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth is a matter of circumstance.</font>

771
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:53,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not all things to all people,
all the time.</font>

772
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:55,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither am I.</font>

773
00:57:56,613 --> 00:57:57,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a tough way to live.</font>

774
00:57:59,093 --> 00:58:01,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good way not to die, though.</font>

775
00:58:02,053 --> 00:58:03,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone,</font>

776
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:05,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you don't know
who that someone really is.</font>

777
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:07,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

778
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:11,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who do you want me to be?</font>

779
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:13,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a friend?</font>

780
00:58:17,053 --> 00:58:21,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's a chance you might be
in the wrong business, Rogers.</font>

781
00:58:36,893 --> 00:58:38,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it.</font>

782
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The file came from these coordinates.</font>

783
00:58:42,733 --> 00:58:43,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So did I.</font>

784
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:53,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This camp is where I was trained.</font>

785
00:58:56,613 --> 00:58:57,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change much?</font>

786
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:01,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little.</font>

787
00:59:01,853 --> 00:59:03,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pick up the pace, ladies!</font>

788
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go! Let's go!</font>

789
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:07,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Double time!</font>

790
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Rogers, move it!</font>

791
00:59:15,173 --> 00:59:16,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, fall in!</font>

792
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:18,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rogers!</font>

793
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:20,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said fall in!</font>

794
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:23,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a dead end.</font>

795
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:26,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.</font>

796
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:31,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever wrote the file must
have used a router to throw people off.</font>

797
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:33,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

798
00:59:34,173 --> 00:59:36,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Army regulations
forbid storing munitions</font>

799
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,096

800
00:59:38,893 --> 00:59:40,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This building is in the wrong place.</font>

801
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:58,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

802
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe where it started.</font>

803
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:20,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's Stark's father.</font>

804

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howard.</font>

805
01:00:24,013 --> 01:00:25,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's the girl?</font>

806
01:00:44,653 --> 01:00:46,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're already working
in a secret office,</font>

807
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:59,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why do you need to hide the elevator?</font>

808
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:54,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y-E-S spells yes.</font>

810
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:32,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shall we play a game?</font>

811
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:35,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's from a movie that was really...

01:05:39,373 --> 01:05:41,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So, I wrote an algorithm.</i></font>

869
01:05:42,293 --> 01:05:43,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?</font>

870
01:05:43,653 --> 01:05:46,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The answer to your question
is fascinating.</i></font>

871
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:50,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.</i></font>

872
01:05:56,493 --> 01:05:57,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve, we got a bogey.</font>

873
01:05:58,373 --> 01:05:59,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Short range ballistic.</font>

874
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:01,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?</font>

875
01:06:02,013 --> 01:06:03,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

876
01:06:03,173 --> 01:06:06,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I am afraid
I have been stalling, Captain.</i></font>

877
01:06:07,453 --> 01:06:08,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Admit it.</i></font>

878
01:06:08,693 --> 01:06:10,934

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>out of time.</i></font>

881
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call in the asset.</font>

882
01:07:56,293 --> 01:07:57,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.</font>

883
01:07:58,213 --> 01:08:00,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need anything before I leave?</font>

884
01:08:00,813 --> 01:08:04,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No... Uh, it's fine, Renata,
you can go home.</font>

885
01:08:04,733 --> 01:08:06,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Night-night.</font>

886
01:08:06,653 --> 01:08:08,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good night.</font>

887
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:14,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want some milk?</font>

888
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:26,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The timetable has moved.</font>

889
01:08:28,453 --> 01:08:30,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our window is limited.</font>

890
01:08:34,213 --> 01:08:36,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two targets, Level Six.</font>

891
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:40,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They already cost me Zola.</font>

892
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:42,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want confirmed death in 10 hours.</font>

893
01:08:44,373 --> 01:08:46,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...</font>

894
01:08:47,013 --> 01:08:48,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot my</font>

895
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:49,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">phone.</font>

896
01:08:54,693 --> 01:08:57,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Renata,
I wish you would have knocked.</font>

897
01:09:22,373 --> 01:09:23,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man.</font>

898
01:09:23,533 --> 01:09:27,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry about this.
We need a place to lay low.</font>

899
01:09:27,253 --> 01:09:28,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone we know is trying to kill us.</font>

900
01:09:31,853 --> 01:09:33,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not everyone.</font>

901
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:52,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

902
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:02,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

903
01:10:05,693 --> 01:10:09,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.</font>

904
01:10:12,933 --> 01:10:15,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I guess I just traded in
the KGB for HYDRA.</font>

905
01:10:21,733 --> 01:10:23,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,</font>

906
01:10:27,613 --> 01:10:30,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I guess I can't tell
the difference any more.</font>

907
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:33,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a chance you might be
in the wrong business.</font>

908
01:10:38,613 --> 01:10:39,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I owe you.</font>

909
01:10:41,253 --> 01:10:42,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

910
01:10:42,853 --> 01:10:45,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it was the other way around,</font>

911
01:10:46,293 --> 01:10:47,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it was down to me to save your life,</font>

912
01:10:47,973 --> 01:10:49,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now you be honest with me,</font>

913
01:10:51,653 --> 01:10:53,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would you trust me to do it?</font>

914
01:10:55,693 --> 01:10:56,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would now.</font>

915
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:01,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm always honest.</font>

916
01:11:02,813 --> 01:11:03,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you seem pretty chipper</font>

917
01:11:04,133 --> 01:11:06,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for someone who just found out
they died for nothing.</font>

918
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:10,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, guess I just like to
know who I'm fighting.</font>

919
01:11:11,293 --> 01:11:12,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made breakfast.</font>

920
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:15,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you guys eat that sort of thing.</font>

921
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:18,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the question is,</font>

922
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:21,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?</font>

923
01:11:23,093 --> 01:11:24,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pierce.</font>

924
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:27,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who happens to be sitting on top
of the most secure building in the world.</font>

925
01:11:27,173 --> 01:11:28,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he's not working alone.</font>

926
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Zola's algorithm
was on the Lemurian Star.</i></font>

927
01:11:32,013 --> 01:11:33,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So was Jasper Sitwell.</font>

928
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:39,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the real question is,
how do the two most wanted people</font>

929
01:11:39,693 --> 01:11:42,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in Washington kidnap
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?</font>

930
01:11:43,453 --> 01:11:45,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer is, you don't.</font>

931
01:11:46,293 --> 01:11:48,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's this?
- Call it a resume.</font>

932
01:11:51,693 --> 01:11:53,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this Bakhmala?</font>

933
01:11:53,453 --> 01:11:55,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Khalid Khandil mission,
that was you?</font>

934
01:11:56,613 --> 01:11:58,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't say he was a Pararescue.</font>

935
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.</font>

936
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:04,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard they couldn't bring
in the choppers because of the RPGs.</font>

937
01:12:04,813 --> 01:12:05,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you use? A stealth chute?</font>

938
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:06,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

939
01:12:07,613 --> 01:12:09,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These.</font>

940
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:15,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you said you were a pilot.</font>

941
01:12:15,573 --> 01:12:16,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never said pilot.</font>

942
01:12:20,893 --> 01:12:22,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't ask you to do this, Sam.</font>

943
01:12:23,253 --> 01:12:24,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got out for a good reason.</font>

944
01:12:24,893 --> 01:12:26,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, Captain America needs my help.</font>

945
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:28,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no better reason to get back in.</font>

946
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:33,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where can we get our hands on
one of these things?</font>

947
01:12:33,773 --> 01:12:34,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last one is at Fort Meade.</font>

948
01:12:35,933 --> 01:12:38,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.</font>

949
01:12:41,493 --> 01:12:42,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shouldn't be a problem.</font>

950
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I got to fly home tonight</font>

951
01:12:46,133 --> 01:12:48,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I got
some constituency problem</font>

952
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:51,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I got to press the flesh.</font>

953
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:53,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any constituent in particular,
Mr. Senator?</font>

954
01:12:54,053 --> 01:12:55,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, not really.</font>

955
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">23, kind of hot.</font>

956
01:12:58,973 --> 01:13:00,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Real hot, you know?</font>

957
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wants to be a reporter, I think.
I don't know.</font>

958
01:13:02,653 --> 01:13:03,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who listens at that point?</font>

959
01:13:03,853 --> 01:13:05,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't sound like
much of a problem to me.</font>

960
01:13:05,693 --> 01:13:07,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Because she's killing my back.</font>

961
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:10,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this isn't the place to talk about it.</font>

962
01:13:10,693 --> 01:13:11,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a nice pin.</font>

963
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Come here.</font>

964
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hail HYDRA.</font>

965
01:13:20,453 --> 01:13:22,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.</font>

966
01:13:23,213 --> 01:13:25,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.</font>

967
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:34,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a minute.</font>

968
01:13:34,853 --> 01:13:36,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring the car around.</font>

969
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:41,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir?</font>

970
01:13:41,373 --> 01:13:43,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?</i></font>

971
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:45,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I hear the crab cakes here
are delicious.</i></font>

972
01:13:45,973 --> 01:13:47,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is this?</font>

973
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.</i></font>

974
01:13:51,973 --> 01:13:53,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Your other 10 o'clock.</i></font>

975
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:55,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There you go.</i></font>

976
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:00,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

977
01:14:00,533 --> 01:14:02,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You're gonna go around
the corner to your right.</i></font>

978
01:14:02,533 --> 01:14:05,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a grey car two spaces down.</font>

979
01:14:05,253 --> 01:14:07,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I are gonna take a ride.</font>

980
01:14:07,293 --> 01:14:09,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And why would I do that?</font>

981
01:14:09,173 --> 01:14:11,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that tie looks really expensive,</font>

982
01:14:12,213 --> 01:14:14,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and I'd hate to mess it up.</i></font>

983
01:14:23,773 --> 01:14:25,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me about Zola's algorithm.</font>

984
01:14:26,093 --> 01:14:27,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never heard of it.</font>

985
01:14:27,173 --> 01:14:28,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What were you doing
on the Lemurian Star?</i></font>

986
01:14:28,293 --> 01:14:30,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was throwing up. I get seasick.</font>

987
01:14:35,213 --> 01:14:38,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?</font>

988
01:14:39,533 --> 01:14:41,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.</font>

989
01:14:42,213 --> 01:14:43,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

990
01:14:44,093 --> 01:14:45,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not.</font>

991
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:46,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's hers.</font>

992
01:14:50,573 --> 01:14:53,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...</font>

993
01:14:53,693 --> 01:14:55,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lillian. Lip piercing, right?</font>

994
01:14:55,613 --> 01:14:56,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, she's cute.</font>

995
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I'm not ready for that.</font>

996
01:15:10,253 --> 01:15:12,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zola's algorithm is a program</font>

997
01:15:14,013 --> 01:15:15,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for choosing</font>

998
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:16,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- insight's targets.
- What targets?</font>

999
01:15:17,253 --> 01:15:18,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You!</font>

1000
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:21,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A TV anchor in Cairo,
the Under Secretary of Defence,</font>

1005
01:15:30,733 --> 01:15:32,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the future? How could it know?</font>

1006
01:15:36,093 --> 01:15:37,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How could it not?</font>

1007

01:15:55,813 --> 01:15:59,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past</font>

1013
01:16:00,053 --> 01:16:01,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to predict their future.</font>

1014
01:16:01,613 --> 01:16:02,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what then?</font>

1015
01:16:06,093 --> 01:16:07,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.</font>

1016
01:16:07,973 --> 01:16:09,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What then?</font>

1017
01:16:12,093 --> 01:16:15,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.</font>

1018
01:16:17,413 --> 01:16:19,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few million at a time.</font>

1019
01:16:26,893 --> 01:16:27,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">HYDRA doesn't like leaks.</font>

1020
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:29,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?</font>

1021
01:16:30,013 --> 01:16:31,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Insight's launching in 16 hours.</font>

1022
01:16:31,493 --> 01:16:32,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're cutting it a little bit close here.</font>

1023
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:34,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.
We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans</font>

1024
01:16:34,813 --> 01:16:36,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and access the helicarriers directly.</font>

1025
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:37,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Are you crazy?</font>

1026
01:16:38,373 --> 01:16:40,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a terrible, terrible idea.</font>

1027
01:17:23,773 --> 01:17:24,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

1028
01:17:36,373 --> 01:17:37,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on!</font>

1029
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:21,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have her. Find him.</font>

1030
01:20:26,373 --> 01:20:27,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! I got this!</font>

1031
01:21:07,413 --> 01:21:09,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Taking fire above
and below expressway.</i></font>

1032
01:21:09,253 --> 01:21:11,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Civilians threatened.
Repeat, civilians threatened.</i></font>

1033
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:18,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I make an LZ,
2300 block of Virginia Avenue.</i></font>

1034
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:19,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Rendezvous, 2 minutes.</i></font>

1035
01:21:45,293 --> 01:21:46,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of the way!</font>

1036
01:21:46,853 --> 01:21:48,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay out of the way!</font>

1037
01:21:49,933 --> 01:21:51,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

1038
01:23:35,533 --> 01:23:36,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bucky?</font>

1039
01:23:37,133 --> 01:23:38,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell is Bucky?</font>

1040
01:24:07,253 --> 01:24:08,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!</font>

1041
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:10,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on your knees!</font>

1042
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:13,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down, get down! Get on your knees!</font>

1043
01:24:13,253 --> 01:24:14,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down!</font>

1044
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:15,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>

1045
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:24,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put the gun down.</font>

1046
01:24:24,413 --> 01:24:26,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not here. Not here!</font>

1047
01:24:41,853 --> 01:24:42,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It was him.</i></font>

1048
01:24:46,133 --> 01:24:49,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He looked right at me
like he didn't even know me.</font>

1049
01:24:50,173 --> 01:24:52,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.</font>

1050
01:24:53,093 --> 01:24:54,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zola.</font>

1051
01:24:54,493 --> 01:24:56,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.</font>

1052
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:58,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Zola experimented on him.</font>

1053
01:24:58,373 --> 01:25:00,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever he did
helped Bucky survive the fall.</font>

1054
01:25:02,373 --> 01:25:03,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They must have found him and...</font>

1055
01:25:03,733 --> 01:25:05,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of that's your fault, Steve.</font>

1056
01:25:09,293 --> 01:25:11,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.</font>

1057
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:16,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to get a doctor here.</font>

1058
01:25:16,253 --> 01:25:17,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't put pressure on that wound,</font>

1059
01:25:17,453 --> 01:25:19,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.</font>

1060
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:29,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain.</font>

1061
01:25:32,573 --> 01:25:33,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is this guy?</font>

1062
01:25:44,453 --> 01:25:46,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three holes. Start digging.</font>

1063
01:26:13,573 --> 01:26:15,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">GSW. She's lost at least a pint.</font>

1064
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:16,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe two.</font>

1065
01:26:17,053 --> 01:26:19,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.</font>

1066
01:26:28,973 --> 01:26:31,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About damn time.</font>

1067
01:26:33,173 --> 01:26:34,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lacerated spinal column,</font>

1068
01:26:35,413 --> 01:26:36,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cracked sternum,</font>

1069
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:38,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shattered collarbone,</font>

1070
01:26:38,573 --> 01:26:40,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">perforated liver,</font>

1071
01:26:40,413 --> 01:26:42,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and one hell of a headache.</font>

1072
01:26:42,413 --> 01:26:43,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't forget your collapsed lung.</font>

1073
01:26:43,973 --> 01:26:45,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's not forget that.</font>

1074
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:47,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Otherwise, I'm good.</font>

1075
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:49,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They cut you open. Your heart stopped.</font>

1076
01:26:49,813 --> 01:26:51,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tetrodotoxin B.</font>

1077
01:26:52,053 --> 01:26:54,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.</font>

1078
01:26:54,213 --> 01:26:56,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Banner developed it for stress.</font>

1079
01:26:56,213 --> 01:26:58,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.</font>

1080
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?</font>

1081
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:03,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.</font>

1082
01:27:03,853 --> 01:27:06,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't kill you if you're already dead.</font>

1083
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:07,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides,</font>

1084
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:10,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wasn't sure who to trust.</font>

1085
01:27:25,813 --> 01:27:27,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sergeant Barnes.</font>

1086
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:30,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bucky, no!</font>

1087
01:27:34,013 --> 01:27:37,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The procedure has already started.</i></font>

1088
01:27:40,973 --> 01:27:44,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.</i></font>

1089
01:27:45,053 --> 01:27:46,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Put him on ice.</i></font>

1090
01:27:57,453 --> 01:27:58,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

1091
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:00,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's unstable.</font>

1092
01:28:01,173 --> 01:28:02,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Erratic.</font>

1093
01:28:15,853 --> 01:28:16,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mission report.</font>

1094
01:28:20,453 --> 01:28:21,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mission report now.</font>

1095
01:28:34,573 --> 01:28:35,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man on the bridge.</font>

1096
01:28:39,133 --> 01:28:40,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who was he?</font>

1097
01:28:41,773 --> 01:28:44,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You met him earlier this week
on another assignment.</font>

1098
01:28:47,133 --> 01:28:48,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew him.</font>

1099
01:28:57,053 --> 01:28:59,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your work has been a gift to mankind.</font>

1100
01:29:02,013 --> 01:29:03,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shaped the century.</font>

1101
01:29:04,093 --> 01:29:06,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I need you to do it one more time.</font>

1102
01:29:07,853 --> 01:29:11,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.</font>

1103
01:29:11,733 --> 01:29:14,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.</font>

1104
01:29:15,533 --> 01:29:18,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, if you don't do your part,
I can't do mine.</font>

1105
01:29:20,413 --> 01:29:23,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.</font>

1106
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:27,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I knew him.</font>

1107
01:29:34,413 --> 01:29:35,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prep him.</font>

1108
01:29:36,133 --> 01:29:38,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been out of cryo freeze too long.</font>

1109
01:29:38,933 --> 01:29:40,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then wipe him and start over.</font>

1110
01:30:22,653 --> 01:30:26,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This man declined
the Nobel Peace Prize.</font>

1111
01:30:26,973 --> 01:30:30,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said peace wasn't an achievement,</font>

1112
01:30:30,693 --> 01:30:32,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was a responsibility.</font>

1113
01:30:33,773 --> 01:30:37,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.</font>

1114
01:30:37,773 --> 01:30:39,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to stop the launch.</font>

1115
01:30:39,973 --> 01:30:42,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls any more.</font>

1116
01:30:45,253 --> 01:30:46,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

1117
01:30:46,693 --> 01:30:49,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,</font>

1118
01:30:49,453 --> 01:30:52,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they'll triangulate with Insight satellites,
becoming fully weaponised.</font>

1119
01:30:53,493 --> 01:30:55,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to breach those carriers</font>

1120
01:30:55,373 --> 01:30:57,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and replace their targeting
blades with our own.</font>

1121
01:30:58,013 --> 01:30:59,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One or two won't cut it.</font>

1122
01:30:59,213 --> 01:31:01,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,</font>

1123
01:31:01,933 --> 01:31:05,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because if even one of those
ships remains operational,</font>

1124
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:07,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a whole lot of people are gonna die.</font>

1125
01:31:07,493 --> 01:31:10,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to assume everyone aboard
those carriers is HYDRA.</font>

1126
01:31:10,973 --> 01:31:13,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.</font>

1127
01:31:13,293 --> 01:31:16,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And maybe, just maybe
we can salvage what's left...</font>

1128
01:31:16,573 --> 01:31:17,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not salvaging anything.</font>

1129
01:31:17,773 --> 01:31:19,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not just
taking down the carriers, Nick.</font>

1130
01:31:19,253 --> 01:31:20,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

1131
01:31:20,373 --> 01:31:21,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.</font>

1132
01:31:21,853 --> 01:31:24,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.</font>

1133
01:31:24,173 --> 01:31:26,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.</font>

1134
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:28,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">HYDRA grew right under your nose
and nobody noticed.</font>

1135
01:31:28,373 --> 01:31:31,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.</font>

1136
01:31:31,893 --> 01:31:33,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many paid the price
before you did?</font>

1137
01:31:36,613 --> 01:31:38,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I didn't know about Barnes.</font>

1138
01:31:38,573 --> 01:31:40,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if you had,
would you have told me?</font>

1139
01:31:40,693 --> 01:31:43,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or would you have
compartmentalised that, too?</font>

1140
01:31:43,613 --> 01:31:46,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,</font>

1141
01:31:46,613 --> 01:31:47,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it all goes.</font>

1142
01:31:48,413 --> 01:31:49,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's right.</font>

1143
01:31:55,413 --> 01:31:56,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't look at me.</font>

1144
01:31:56,653 --> 01:31:58,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do what he does, just slower.</font>

1145
01:32:02,253 --> 01:32:03,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1146
01:32:10,173 --> 01:32:12,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.</font>

1147
01:32:24,213 --> 01:32:25,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We looked for you, after.</i></font>

1148
01:32:26,973 --> 01:32:28,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i></font>

1149
01:32:29,173 --> 01:32:32,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I'm sorry.
I just kind of wanted to be alone.</font>

1150
01:32:33,893 --> 01:32:35,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was it?</font>

1151
01:32:35,773 --> 01:32:37,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was okay.</font>

1152
01:32:37,693 --> 01:32:39,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's next to Dad.</font>

1153
01:32:41,093 --> 01:32:42,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was gonna ask...</font>

1154
01:32:42,773 --> 01:32:44,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're gonna say, Buck.
I just...</font>

1155
01:32:45,413 --> 01:32:46,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can put the
couch cushions on the floor</font>

1156
01:32:47,133 --> 01:32:48,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like when we were kids.</font>

1157
01:32:49,293 --> 01:32:51,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be fun.
All you got to do is shine my shoes,</font>

1158
01:32:52,213 --> 01:32:53,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe take out the trash.</font>

1159
01:32:58,933 --> 01:33:00,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1160
01:33:03,373 --> 01:33:06,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Buck,
but I can get by on my own.</font>

1161
01:33:07,613 --> 01:33:11,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing is, you don't have to.</font>

1162
01:33:14,733 --> 01:33:16,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.</font>

1163
01:33:19,653 --> 01:33:21,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gonna be there, you know.</font>

1164
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:22,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1165
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:26,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, whoever he used to be
and the guy he is now,</font>

1166
01:33:26,973 --> 01:33:29,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think he's the kind you save.</font>

1167
01:33:29,373 --> 01:33:30,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the kind you stop.</font>

1168
01:33:33,493 --> 01:33:35,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if I can do that.</font>

1169
01:33:35,413 --> 01:33:37,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he might not give you a choice.</font>

1170
01:33:37,573 --> 01:33:39,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't know you.</font>

1171
01:33:39,773 --> 01:33:40,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He will.</font>

1172
01:33:43,573 --> 01:33:44,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gear up. It's time.</font>

1173
01:33:47,493 --> 01:33:48,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna wear that?</font>

1174
01:33:48,853 --> 01:33:52,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. If you're gonna fight a war,
you got to wear a uniform.</font>

1175
01:34:00,133 --> 01:34:01,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.</font>

1176
01:34:02,373 --> 01:34:04,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so fired.</font>

1177
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:31,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We are in final launch sequence.</i></font>

1178
01:34:33,213 --> 01:34:35,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are go on guidance.</font>

1179
01:34:37,053 --> 01:34:39,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All personnel to launch stations.</i></font>

1180
01:34:39,933 --> 01:34:41,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how was your flight?</font>

1181
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:42,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lovely.</font>

1182
01:34:42,453 --> 01:34:44,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ride from the airport, less so.</font>

1183
01:34:45,053 --> 01:34:47,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.</font>

1184
01:34:47,733 --> 01:34:49,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Including Captain America.</font>

1185
01:34:53,093 --> 01:34:55,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This facility is biometrically controlled.</font>

1186
01:34:55,853 --> 01:34:58,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these will give you
unrestricted access.</font>

1187
01:35:02,693 --> 01:35:03,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been parking there for 2 months.</font>

1188
01:35:04,093 --> 01:35:05,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's his spot.
So where's he been?</font>

1189
01:35:05,893 --> 01:35:07,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Afghanistan.</font>

1190
01:35:07,213 --> 01:35:09,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.</font>

1191
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:10,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he could've said something.</font>

1192
01:35:10,813 --> 01:35:12,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ahh!</font>

1193
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:13,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must be the dish.</font>

1194
01:35:15,493 --> 01:35:17,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll check it out.</font>

1195
01:35:17,933 --> 01:35:20,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Triskelion command
request we clear the area for launch.</i></font>

1196
01:35:24,613 --> 01:35:25,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse us.</font>

1197
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:28,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I know the road
hasn't exactly been smooth,</i></font>

1198
01:35:28,613 --> 01:35:31,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.</font>

1199
01:35:34,213 --> 01:35:35,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally, we're here.</font>

1200
01:35:35,893 --> 01:35:37,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the world should be grateful.</font>

1201
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:40,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Attention all S.H.I E.L.D. agents,</i></font>

1202
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:42,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>this is Steve Rogers.</i></font>

1203
01:35:44,253 --> 01:35:46,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You've heard a lot about me
over the last few days.</i></font>

1204
01:35:47,493 --> 01:35:49,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Some of you were even ordered
to hunt me down.</i></font>

1205
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:53,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I think it's time you know the truth.</font>

1206
01:35:56,493 --> 01:35:58,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.</font>

1207
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:00,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been taken over by HYDRA.</font>

1208
01:36:01,693 --> 01:36:03,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i></font>

1209
01:36:07,493 --> 01:36:09,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew
are HYDRA as well.</i></font>

1210
01:36:10,013 --> 01:36:11,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't know how many more,</i></font>

1211
01:36:12,373 --> 01:36:13,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I know they're in the building.</font>

1212
01:36:15,173 --> 01:36:17,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They could be standing
right next to you.</i></font>

1213
01:36:18,613 --> 01:36:20,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They almost have what they want.</i></font>

1214
01:36:21,093 --> 01:36:23,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Absolute control.</i></font>

1215
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:25,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They shot Nick Fury.</font>

1216
01:36:26,133 --> 01:36:27,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And it won't end there.</i></font>

1217
01:36:27,813 --> 01:36:30,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you launch those helicarriers today,</font>

1218
01:36:30,173 --> 01:36:32,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.</i></font>

1219
01:36:35,453 --> 01:36:36,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Unless we stop them.</i></font>

1220
01:36:40,853 --> 01:36:41,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i></font>

1221
01:36:43,893 --> 01:36:47,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But the price of freedom is high.
It always has been.</i></font>

1222
01:36:47,813 --> 01:36:49,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's a price I'm willing to pay.</font>

1223
01:36:52,053 --> 01:36:54,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if I'm the only one, then so be it.</font>

1224
01:36:56,533 --> 01:36:58,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm willing to bet I'm not.</font>

1225
01:37:03,053 --> 01:37:06,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you write that down first,
or was it off the top of your head?</font>

1226
01:37:06,853 --> 01:37:08,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You smug son of a bitch.</font>

1227
01:37:12,533 --> 01:37:13,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arrest him.</font>

1228
01:37:16,453 --> 01:37:18,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I've got the floor.</font>

1229
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:27,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.</font>

1230
01:37:32,293 --> 01:37:33,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a problem?</font>

1231
01:37:33,853 --> 01:37:34,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

1232
01:37:38,813 --> 01:37:39,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a problem?</font>

1233
01:37:40,093 --> 01:37:41,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, sir.</font>

1234
01:37:49,893 --> 01:37:52,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna launch those ships.</font>

1235
01:37:54,813 --> 01:37:56,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain's orders.</font>

1236
01:37:56,293 --> 01:37:57,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move away from your station.</font>

1237
01:37:57,933 --> 01:37:58,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like he said...</font>

1238
01:37:59,133 --> 01:38:00,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it right there.</font>

1239
01:38:00,253 --> 01:38:01,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put the gun down!</font>

1240
01:38:01,773 --> 01:38:02,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain's orders.</font>

1241
01:38:05,173 --> 01:38:06,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You picked the wrong side, Agent.</font>

1242
01:38:08,453 --> 01:38:10,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Depends on where you're standing.</font>

1243
01:38:54,453 --> 01:38:56,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close the bay door!</font>

1244
01:38:56,093 --> 01:38:57,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close the bay door now!</font>

1245
01:38:57,813 --> 01:38:58,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close the bay door!</font>

1246
01:39:18,653 --> 01:39:19,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're initiating launch.</font>

1247
01:39:40,053 --> 01:39:42,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Cap, how do we know
the good guys from the bad guys?</font>

1248
01:39:42,853 --> 01:39:44,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they're shooting at you, they're bad.</font>

1249
01:40:17,693 --> 01:40:18,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Cap,</font>

1250
01:40:18,893 --> 01:40:20,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found those bad guys
you were talking about.</font>

1251
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:21,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1252
01:40:24,133 --> 01:40:25,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not dead yet.</font>

1253
01:40:32,613 --> 01:40:34,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me ask you a question.</font>

1254
01:40:36,893 --> 01:40:40,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow</font>

1255
01:40:41,293 --> 01:40:43,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters</font>

1256
01:40:43,653 --> 01:40:46,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into a soccer stadium for execution,</font>

1257
01:40:48,853 --> 01:40:52,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.</font>

1258
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:53,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't you?</font>

1259
01:40:53,773 --> 01:40:55,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't you all?</font>

1260
01:40:57,293 --> 01:40:58,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not if it was your switch.</font>

1261
01:41:23,293 --> 01:41:24,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1262
01:41:30,933 --> 01:41:32,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I step on your moment?</font>

1263
01:41:34,053 --> 01:41:36,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.</font>

1266
01:42:03,973 --> 01:42:05,259

1267
01:42:07,653 --> 01:42:08,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

1268

1270
01:42:50,893 --> 01:42:51,988

1271
01:42:52,013 --> 01:42:53,668

<font face="Comic Sans MS">So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?</font>

1297
01:45:56,653 --> 01:45:57,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you were the best,</font>

1298
01:45:58,133 --> 01:45:59,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the most ruthless person
I ever met.</font>

1299
01:45:59,893 --> 01:46:02,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did what I did to protect people.</font>

1300
01:46:03,053 --> 01:46:05,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.</font>

1301
01:46:05,933 --> 01:46:08,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Disorder. War.</font>

1302
01:46:09,253 --> 01:46:11,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a matter of time
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diplomacy?</font>

1305
01:46:17,093 --> 01:46:19,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.</font>

1306

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know where
I learned that. Bogota.</font>

1307
01:46:25,013 --> 01:46:27,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't ask.
You just did what had to be done.</font>

1308
01:46:28,933 --> 01:46:33,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people</font>

1309
01:46:33,933 --> 01:46:35,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by sacrificing 20 million.</font>

1310
01:46:37,133 --> 01:46:39,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the next step, Nick.</font>

1311
01:46:39,293 --> 01:46:40,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you have the courage to take it.</font>

of me, Mr. Secretary,</font>

1328

02:03:23,573 --> 02:03:25,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.</font>

1441
02:03:27,453 --> 02:03:29,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going to put me in a prison.</font>

1442
02:03:30,053 --> 02:03:33,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going to put any of us
in a prison. You know why?</font>

1443
02:03:35,413 --> 02:03:36,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do enlighten us.</font>

1444
02:03:37,093 --> 02:03:38,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you need us.</font>

1445
02:03:39,533 --> 02:03:41,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,</i></font>

1446
02:03:42,013 --> 02:03:44,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i></font>

1447
02:03:44,733 --> 02:03:47,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But we're also the ones
best qualified to defend it.</i></font>

1448
02:03:49,133 --> 02:03:51,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.</font>

1449
02:03:52,133 --> 02:03:53,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll know where to find me.</font>

1450
02:04:29,293 --> 02:04:32,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.</font>

1451
02:04:32,653 --> 02:04:34,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get used to it.</font>

1452
02:04:36,893 --> 02:04:39,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been data mining HYDRA'S files.</font>

1453
02:04:39,293 --> 02:04:41,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.</font>

1454
02:04:42,973 --> 02:04:44,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm headed to Europe tonight.</font>

1455
02:04:45,293 --> 02:04:46,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanted to ask if you'd come.</font>

1456
02:04:47,693 --> 02:04:49,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something I got to do first.</font>

1457
02:04:50,253 --> 02:04:52,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you, Wilson?
Could use a man with your abilities.</font>

1458
02:04:53,853 --> 02:04:55,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm more of a soldier than a spy.</font>

1459
02:04:56,653 --> 02:04:58,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, then.</font>

1460
02:05:03,053 --> 02:05:07,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody asks for me,
tell them they can find me, right here.</font>

1461
02:05:09,053 --> 02:05:10,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be honoured.
That's about as close as he gets</font>

1462
02:05:10,853 --> 02:05:12,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to saying thank you.</font>

1463
02:05:13,653 --> 02:05:14,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not going with him?</font>

1464
02:05:15,213 --> 02:05:16,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1465
02:05:16,693 --> 02:05:18,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not staying here.
- Nah.</font>

1466
02:05:19,533 --> 02:05:21,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I blew all my covers.
I got to go figure out a new one.</font>

1467
02:05:21,893 --> 02:05:22,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That might take a while.</font>

1468
02:05:23,413 --> 02:05:25,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm counting on it.</font>

1469
02:05:27,253 --> 02:05:28,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing you asked for,</font>

1470
02:05:28,733 --> 02:05:31,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I called in a few favours from Kiev.</font>

1471
02:05:34,013 --> 02:05:36,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you do me a favour? Call that nurse.</font>

1472
02:05:37,173 --> 02:05:38,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not a nurse.</font>

1473
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:40,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.</font>

1474
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:43,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was her name again?
- Sharon.</font>

1475
02:05:44,173 --> 02:05:45,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's nice.</font>

1476
02:05:57,653 --> 02:05:59,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful, Steve.</font>

1477
02:06:00,253 --> 02:06:01,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might not want to
pull on that thread.</font>

1478
02:06:13,533 --> 02:06:15,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going after him.</font>

1479
02:06:15,693 --> 02:06:16,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to come with me.</font>

1480
02:06:17,133 --> 02:06:18,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1481
02:06:20,173 --> 02:06:21,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When do we start?</font>

1482
02:08:20,733 --> 02:08:24,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.</font>

1483
02:08:25,093 --> 02:08:26,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything he knows about.</font>

1484
02:08:27,013 --> 02:08:28,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Herr Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,</i></font>

1485
02:08:29,053 --> 02:08:30,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if they find out we serve HYDRA...</font>

1486
02:08:31,053 --> 02:08:32,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.</font>

1487
02:08:33,773 --> 02:08:36,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two sides of a coin
that's no longer currency.</font>

1488
02:08:40,453 --> 02:08:41,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we have</font>

1489
02:08:43,973 --> 02:08:46,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is worth more than
any of them ever knew.</font>

1490
02:08:49,253 --> 02:08:52,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've only scratched
the surface and already,</font>

1491
02:08:55,733 --> 02:08:59,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.</font>

1492
02:09:00,733 --> 02:09:04,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colourful friends,</font>

1493
02:09:04,373 --> 02:09:06,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and keep them off our scent.</font>

1494
02:09:06,413 --> 02:09:08,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the volunteers?</font>

1495
02:09:08,893 --> 02:09:10,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dead will be buried so deep</font>

1496
02:09:10,653 --> 02:09:12,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.</font>

1497
02:09:14,853 --> 02:09:16,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the survivors?</font>

1498
02:09:18,213 --> 02:09:19,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The twins.</font>

1499
02:09:23,293 --> 02:09:26,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.</font>

1500
02:09:28,613 --> 02:09:30,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a world of spies any more.</font>

1501
02:09:30,733 --> 02:09:32,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even a world of heroes.</font>

1502
02:09:33,693 --> 02:09:36,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the age of miracles, Doctor.</font>

1503
02:09:38,293 --> 02:09:40,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing more horrifying</font>

1504
02:09:41,413 --> 02:09:42,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than a miracle.</font>
