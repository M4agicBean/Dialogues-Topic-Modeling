1
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did that kill it?
- No.</font>

2
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how we kill it.</font>

3
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Book of Vishanti!</font>

4
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't let it take your power.</font>

5
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get to the book.</font>

6
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do we get across?
- Jump.</font>

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on!</font>

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

9
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too strong.</font>

10
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't hold it.</font>

11
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

12
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the only way.</font>

13
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you doing?</font>

14
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't let that thing take your power.</font>

15
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't control it.</font>

16
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can.</font>

17
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're friends.</font>

18
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're killing me.</font>

19
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

20
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in the grand calculus
of the Multiverse,</font>

21
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your sacrifice
is worth more than your...</font>

22
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me. May I?</font>

23
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

24
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor Strange.</font>

25
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor West.</font>

26
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haven't seen you in a while.</font>

27
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I was a little preoccupied
being dust there for five years, so...</font>

28
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So were a lot of us.</font>

29
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While I was gone,</font>

30
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thank you for asking,</font>

31
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost both my cats...</font>

32
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my brother.</font>

33
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm very sorry.</font>

34
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

35
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh...</font>

36
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess what keeps me up
at night is wondering,</font>

37
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did it have to happen that way?</font>

38
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was there any other path?</font>

39
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

40
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I made the only play we had.</font>

41
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, of course you did.</font>

42
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best surgeon and the best superhero.</font>

43
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you still didn't get the girl.</font>

44
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Glass of red, please.</font>

45
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, allow me, miss.
- Mm.</font>

46
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ah.
- Little too on the nose?</font>

47
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? For you, at my wedding?</font>

48
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah. I think it was perfect.</font>

49
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations.</font>

50
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

51
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm. There's Charlie.</font>

52
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to introduce you
because he's kind of...</font>

53
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's embarrassing,
but he's a big fan, so...</font>

54
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, uh, Christine. Um...</font>

55
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should've...</font>

56
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I'd have been different.</font>

57
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never stopped caring about us.</font>

58
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I had to make sacrifices</font>

59
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to protect you.</font>

60
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

61
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was never gonna work out
between us.</font>

62
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

63
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because, Stephen,</font>

64
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have to be the one
holding the knife.</font>

65
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I always respected you for it,</font>

66
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I couldn't love you for it.</font>

67
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long you had that one
in the barrel?</font>

68
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Long time.</font>

69
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I bet.</font>

70
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, um...</font>

71
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.</font>

72
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

73
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am.</font>

74
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really, really am.</font>

75
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

76
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you?</font>

77
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm happy.</font>

78
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

79
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You deserve it.</font>

80
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man.
Look out! What is that?</font>

81
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude!</font>

82
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

83
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

84
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

85
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out!</font>

86
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I know you?</font>

87
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help!</font>

88
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome.</font>

89
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it's ancient custom</font>

90
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to bow in the presence
of the Sorcerer Supreme?</font>

91
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.</font>

92
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it, hold it! Whoa!</font>

93
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

94
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's incredible.</font>

95
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

96
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

97
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's this?</font>

98
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.</font>

99
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid.</font>

100
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did that creature want with you?</font>

101
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where're your parents?</font>

102
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll take her back to the Sanc...</font>

103
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She took my Slingie.</font>

104
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She took your Slingie.</font>

105
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it was crazy, man.</font>

106
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

107
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna kill you, kid.</font>

108
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just bust my ass
trying to save your life, remember?</font>

109
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Giant monsters I can clearly handle,</font>

110
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what bothers me is that last night,
you were in my dream.</font>

111
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That wasn't a dream.</font>

112
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was another universe.</font>

113
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much experience do you guys have
with the Multiverse?</font>

114
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have experience of the Multiverse.</font>

115
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most recently, there was
an incident with Spider-Man.</font>

116
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What man?</font>

117
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spider-Man.
He has the powers of a spider.</font>

118
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hence the name.
- Gross.</font>

119
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does he look like a spider?
- No. No, more like a man.</font>

120
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Climbs walls, shoots webs.</font>

121
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Bingo.
- Out of his butt?</font>

122
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

123
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe, I don't know.</font>

124
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:40,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, I hope not.</font>

125
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Super weird.</font>

126
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna get a stomach ache.</font>

127
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm from another universe.</font>

128
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know my stomach
works the same as yours?</font>

129
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't.</font>

130
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know
if you're from another universe,</font>

131
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is why I'm still sitting here,
waiting for you</font>

132
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to enlighten us.</font>

133
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta say,</font>

134
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the two Doctor Stranges
I've met so far...</font>

135
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...you're not my favorite.</font>

136
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means?</font>

137
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he not know Spanish?</font>

138
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure
he even enjoys speaking English.</font>

139
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look,
I left a very nice wedding</font>

140
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to save a smart-ass kid
from getting eaten by an octopus.</font>

141
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whose wedding?
- Now tell me...</font>

142
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Christine's.
- You went?</font>

143
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, you married Christine?</font>

144
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.</font>

145
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I didn't. Yes.</font>

146
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to explain to me
what's going on.</font>

147
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why was that octopus trying to eat you?</font>

148
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing was trying to kidnap me.</font>

149
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a henchman
who works for a demon.</font>

150
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All we knew is that they wanted
to take my power for themselves.</font>

151
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What power?</font>

152
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can travel the Multiverse.</font>

153
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

154
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can physically move
from one universe to another?</font>

155
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mm-hmm.
- How?</font>

156
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the problem.
I don't know how.</font>

157
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't control it.</font>

158
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only happens when
I'm really, really afraid.</font>

159
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. And did Other Me know
how to defeat this demon?</font>

160
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you guys knew</font>

161
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of this magical book of pure good</font>

162
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that gives a sorcerer whatever they need
to defeat their enemy.</font>

163
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Book of Vishanti?</font>

164
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not real.</font>

165
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a fairy tale.
It doesn't exist.</font>

166
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, it does.</font>

167
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found out in the secret book you get
when you become Sorcerer Supreme.</font>

168
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbelievable.</font>

169
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?</font>

170
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not the Sorcerer Supreme.</font>

171
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other You was Sorcerer Supreme
of his universe.</font>

172
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Yeah.</font>

173
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Although it does exist,</font>

174
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Book of Vishanti
is said to be unreachable.</font>

175
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is. Except...</font>

176
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we reached it.</font>

177
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the demon caught up with us.</font>

178
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you'd protect me...</font>

179
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you didn't.</font>

180
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the fight in my dream.</font>

181
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That wasn't a dream.</font>

182
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prove it.</font>

183
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't a dream.</font>

184
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means...</font>

185
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dreams are windows into the lives
of our Multiversal selves.</font>

186
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was his theory.</font>

187
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, that recurring nightmare
where I'm running naked from a clown...</font>

188
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere out there, it's real.</font>

189
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.</font>

190
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There could be
more creatures coming for her.</font>

191
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The power is dangerous enough
in the hands of a kid.</font>

192
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imagine if a real threat acquired it?</font>

193
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It occurs to me, young one,
we don't know your name.</font>

194
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America Chavez.</font>

195
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Chavez, will you come
with us to Kamar-Taj?</font>

196
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be safe there.</font>

197
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do I know you won't
betray me like he did?</font>

198
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me.</font>

199
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we do with him?</font>

200
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's gotta violate an ordinance.</font>

201
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, I've buried worse.</font>

202
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The creature that killed him, did...</font>

203
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did it have the same markings
as the octopus?</font>

204
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Runes.</font>

205
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't sorcery.</font>

206
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's witchcraft.</font>

207
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we know anyone
who's faced such a thing?</font>

208
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I might.</font>

209
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Chocolate!
- Hey! What did I say?</font>

210
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we couldn't wait.</font>

211
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what did I say?</font>

212
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

213
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go wash your hands.</font>

214
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, come on.
We're too old for that.</font>

215
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, okay.</font>

216
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tuck me in, Mom.</font>

217
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>

218
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, a family is forever.</font>

219
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could never truly leave each other,
even if we tried.</font>

220
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, I changed my mind.</font>

221
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can come tuck me in if you want.</font>

222
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

223
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love you.</font>

224
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apples, right?</font>

225
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eventually.
- Hmm.</font>

226
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Smells...
- Sweet.</font>

227
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was gonna say real.</font>

228
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's all very real, thanks.</font>

229
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've put the magic behind me.</font>

230
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I can see.</font>

231
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up,</font>

232
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wanting to discuss
what happened at Westview.</font>

233
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made mistakes,
and people were hurt...</font>

234
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you put things right in the end,
and that was never in doubt.</font>

235
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not here to talk about Westview.</font>

236
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what are you here for?</font>

237
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need your help.</font>

238
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With what?</font>

239
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know about the Multiverse?</font>

240
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Multiverse.</font>

241
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vis had his theories.</font>

242
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He believed it was real,
and dangerous.</font>

243
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he was right about both.</font>

244
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found a girl
who can somehow travel across it,</font>

245
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but she's being pursued.</font>

246
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pursued by who?
- Some kind of demon.</font>

247
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- One that covets her power for itself.
- Ah.</font>

248
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've taken her to Kamar-Taj,
and we've got our defenses,</font>

249
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we could use an Avenger.</font>

250
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are other Avengers.</font>

251
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but given the choice
between the archer with the mohawk</font>

252
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and several bug-themed crime fighters,</font>

253
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:04,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or one of the most powerful
magic-wielders on the planet...</font>

254
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...it's an easy call.</font>

255
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come to Kamar-Taj.</font>

256
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll get you back on the lunch box.</font>

257
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if you brought America here?</font>

258
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here?</font>

259
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I know what it's like
to be on your own,</font>

260
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hunted for abilities you never wanted,</font>

261
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can protect her.</font>

262
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never told me her name, did you?</font>

263
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

264
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mm.
- No, I didn't.</font>

265
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the Hex was the easy part.</font>

266
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lying, not so much.</font>

267
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Darkhold.</font>

268
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're familiar with the Darkhold?</font>

269
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's the Book of the Damned,</font>

270
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that it corrupts everything
and everyone that it touches.</font>

271
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder what it's done to you.</font>

272
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Darkhold only showed me the truth.</font>

273
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything I lost can be mine again.</font>

274
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want with America?</font>

275
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want with the Multiverse?</font>

276
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to leave this reality</font>

277
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and go to one where I can be
with my children.</font>

278
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, your children aren't real.</font>

279
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You created them using magic.</font>

280
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what every mother does.</font>

281
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you knew</font>

282
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there was a universe</font>

283
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where you were happy,</font>

284
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wouldn't you want to go there?</font>

285
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am happy.</font>

286
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know better than most
what self-deception looks like.</font>

287
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you're doing is a flagrant violation
of every natural law,</font>

288
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if you take that child's power,</font>

289
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she won't survive.</font>

290
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.</font>

291
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she's not a child.</font>

292
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a supernatural being.</font>

293
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such raw power could wreak havoc on this</font>

294
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and other worlds.</font>

295
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her sacrifice</font>

296
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would be for the greater good.</font>

297
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye,</font>

298
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause that's the kind of justification
our enemies use.</font>

299
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it the one you used</font>

300
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?</font>

301
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was a war,
and I did what I had to do.</font>

302
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You break the rules and become a hero.</font>

303
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do it, and I become the enemy.</font>

304
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't seem fair.</font>

305
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens now?</font>

306
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return to Kamar-Taj</font>

307
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and prepare to hand over
America Chavez by sundown.</font>

308
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peacefully.</font>

309
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After that...</font>

310
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never see me again.</font>

311
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if we don't?</font>

312
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then it won't be Wanda
who comes for her.</font>

313
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will be the Scarlet Witch.</font>

314
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Scarlet Witch.</font>

315
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda's gone.</font>

316
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's got the Darkhold,
and the Darkhold has her.</font>

317
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Scarlet Witch is
a being of unfathomable magic.</font>

318
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She can rewrite reality as she chooses,</font>

319
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and is prophesized to either rule</font>

320
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or annihilate the cosmos.</font>

321
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She took over a whole town using her mind.</font>

322
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she gets America's power,</font>

323
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she could enslave the entire Multiverse.</font>

324
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the person you went to ask for help,</font>

325
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and told exactly where I am,</font>

326
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is the person that's trying to kill me?</font>

327
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

328
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suspend teaching at once
and arm the students.</font>

329
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.</font>

330
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

331
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the masters of the Hong Kong
and London Sanctums.</font>

332
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an honor to court death
alongside you once again.</font>

333
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The honor is ours.</font>

334
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever the
Sorcerer Supreme asks of us,</font>

335
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it shall be done.</font>

336
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Extra duty men,
follow me.</font>

337
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's ancient custom.</font>

338
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choose your words wisely.</font>

339
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fate of the Multiverse
may depend on it.</font>

340
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>

341
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No pressure, then.</font>

342
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All this for a child you met yesterday.</font>

343
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, you are justifiably angry.</font>

344
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had to make terrible sacrifices.</font>

345
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I blew a hole through the head
of the man I loved,</font>

346
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it meant nothing.</font>

347
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not speak to me of sacrifice,
Stephen Strange.</font>

348
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you give me what I want,</font>

349
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll send you to a world where
you can be with Christine.</font>

350
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The full might of Kamar-Taj
stands against you.</font>

351
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Defensive positions, now!</font>

352
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.</font>

353
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:40,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea
just how reasonable I have been.</font>

354
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

355
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Book of the Damned,
calling yourself a witch,</font>

356
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">conjuring creatures to abduct a kid,</font>

357
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't exactly call that
being reasonable.</font>

358
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sending those creatures
after her instead of myself</font>

359
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was mercy.</font>

360
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in spite of your hypocrisies,
and insults,</font>

361
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have begged you
to safely get out of my way.</font>

362
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have exhausted my patience,</font>

363
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I do hope you understand
that even now,</font>

364
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what's about to happen,</font>

365
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is me</font>

366
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">being reasonable.</font>

367
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold!</font>

368
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold!</font>

369
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nailed it.</font>

370
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reinforce the shield.</font>

371
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reinforce the shield!</font>

372
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reinforce the shield!</font>

373
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's trying to get in their heads.</font>

374
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorcerers, fortify your mind!</font>

375
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run.</font>

376
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The shield is down!</font>

377
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

378
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

379
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take cover!</font>

380
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire at will!</font>

381
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fall back.</font>

382
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wong!</font>

383
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here!</font>

384
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go.</font>

385
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

386
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America...</font>

387
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want the girl,
you'll have to go through me.</font>

388
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

389
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta get you out of here. Now.</font>

390
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wong, what happened?</font>

391
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kamar-Taj has fallen.</font>

392
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reflections.</font>

393
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's using the reflections.
Cover them.</font>

394
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave all those lives</font>

395
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just to keep me from my children.</font>

396
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took those lives.</font>

397
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot be allowed
to cross into the Multiverse.</font>

398
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a monster, Stephen.</font>

399
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a mother.</font>

400
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, you have no children.</font>

401
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't exist.</font>

402
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, but they do.</font>

403
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In every other universe.</font>

404
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know they do.</font>

405
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I dream of them</font>

406
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every night.</font>

407
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna show it.</font>

408
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, watch us. Mom!</font>

409
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go long. Got it!</font>

410
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, go on back, go on back.</font>

411
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, yeah. Don't...</font>

412
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of my boys.</font>

413
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, don't you dare! No!</font>

414
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of our life together.</font>

415
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here.
- Yes!</font>

416
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then back to front.</font>

417
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back to front.</font>

418
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I have some?</font>

419
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please?</font>

420
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you guys ready?
- It's okay.</font>

421
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Mom.</font>

422
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every night...</font>

423
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the same dream.</font>

424
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And every morning...</font>

425
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the same nightmare.</font>

426
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if you reach them?</font>

427
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens to the other you?</font>

428
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens to their mother?</font>

429
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

430
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saved me.</font>

431
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope so.</font>

432
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surprised you didn't puke.</font>

433
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not my first weird trip, kid.</font>

434
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this is New York
in the Multi...</font>

435
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>

436
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is.</font>

437
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crap.</font>

438
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut it out.</font>

439
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.</font>

440
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll get you fixed.</font>

441
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, America.</font>

442
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta open a portal
and get us back there right now.</font>

443
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how.</font>

444
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just did it.</font>

445
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not on purpose.</font>

446
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wong is back there alone with Wanda,
and I'm the only hope he has.</font>

447
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't control my powers...</font>

448
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be able to control it somehow.</font>

449
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even I could...</font>

450
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

451
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what about this
universe's version of you?</font>

452
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe she could
control her powers.</font>

453
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This universe doesn't have a me.</font>

454
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- None of them do.</font>

455
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how do you know that?</font>

456
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I've looked.</font>

457
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And 'cause I never dream.</font>

458
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's okay, kid.</font>

459
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even if you could get me back there,
I have no way of fighting Wanda.</font>

460
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about The Book of Vishanti?</font>

461
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about it?</font>

462
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other You thought it could stop</font>

463
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whoever was after me.</font>

464
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, good for Other Me.
He's not here, is he?</font>

465
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know where it is,
so unless there's another Other Me...</font>

466
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to go find...</font>

467
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other Other Me.</font>

468
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We go on red?</font>

469
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rule number one of Multiversal travel,</font>

470
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:25,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you don't know anything.</font>

471
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

472
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's red.</font>

473
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's rule number 2?</font>

474
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America?</font>

475
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America!</font>

476
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rule number 2,</font>

477
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">find food.</font>

478
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.</font>

479
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you pay for that?</font>

480
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was free.</font>

481
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Food's free
in most universes, actually.</font>

482
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's weird you guys have to pay for it.</font>

483
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey! You didn't pay for that.
- Right.</font>

484
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crap.</font>

485
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's not free here.</font>

486
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pizza Poppa always gets paid.</font>

487
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Pizza Poppa, relax.
She's just a kid...</font>

488
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She was hungry.
- Relax yourself, there,</font>

489
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor Strange.</font>

490
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd you get
this cape from, anyway?</font>

491
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that feels authentic.</font>

492
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a cape, it's a cloak,
and I suggest you let go.</font>

493
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took this whole suit
from the Strange Museum, didn't you?</font>

494
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Strange Museum?
- You're a taker.</font>

495
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you take some mustard, huh?</font>

496
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. It's not permanent.</font>

497
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like he'll stop in a few minutes?</font>

498
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About 3 weeks.</font>

499
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those universes we went through,</font>

500
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were we paint in one of them?</font>

501
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you don't wanna get stuck in there.</font>

502
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's really hard to eat.</font>

503
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many universes have you been to?</font>

504
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

505
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">72.</font>

506
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">73, counting this one.</font>

507
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's...</font>

508
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a lot.</font>

509
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Memory Lane.</font>

510
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,731

513
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is pretty fancy.</font>

514
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you have to take out
another student loan?</font>

515
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:25,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys
that we operated on last week.</font>

516
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, um, got you a little something.</font>

517
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Congratulations.</font>

518
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

519
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open it and see.</font>

520
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christine, this is...</font>

521
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is amazing. Thank you.</font>

522
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have time for this.</font>

523
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,030

527
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,336

528
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Home.</font>

529
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My moms.</font>

530
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son mis madres.</font>

531
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">¿Para mí? Ay, qué linda.</font>

532
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gracias.</font>

533
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A ver, te la pongo.</font>

534
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm. Tan hermosa.</font>

535
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Te ves bella.</font>

536
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ándale, nos van a dar otra flor.</font>

537
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America!</font>

538
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you were right.
This is just a waste of time.</font>

539
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid.</font>

540
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the first time
that you opened a portal, right?</font>

541
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't matter.</font>

542
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does matter.
You lost your parents.</font>

543
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't lose them.
I killed them.</font>

544
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, you did not.
Don't even think that.</font>

545
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I opened a portal
with the powers I can't control</font>

546
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and sent them to a random,
probably deadly universe,</font>

547
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- with no way to escape.
- Listen,</font>

548
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if your moms are
anything like their daughter,</font>

549
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they survived.</font>

550
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.</font>

551
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad.</font>

552
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

553
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That woman in your memory bank thing,</font>

554
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was Christine, right?</font>

555
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that was Christine.</font>

556
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do you know her?
- From Other You.</font>

557
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were they together?</font>

558
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they didn't talk anymore.</font>

559
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He blew it.</font>

560
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

561
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you blow it with your Christine?</font>

562
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I guess I did.</font>

563
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

564
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Complicated.</font>

565
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More complicated
than being chased by a witch</font>

566
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">through the Multiverse?</font>

567
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, actually, it is.</font>

568
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?</font>

569
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. See? We're not all bad.</font>

570
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Other You's dead,</font>

571
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's Master of the Sanctum?</font>

572
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

573
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know him?
- Yeah. Mordo.</font>

574
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was actually the first guy
who let me into Kamar-Taj.</font>

575
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:20,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, great.</font>

576
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then he snapped</font>

577
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and dedicated his life
to trying to kill me.</font>

578
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

579
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

580
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always suspected
this day would come.</font>

581
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did?</font>

582
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

583
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:41,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you always suspected
this day would come.</font>

584
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My brother.</font>

585
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

586
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come in,</font>

587
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:03,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and tell me everything
about your universe.</font>

588
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go on red.</font>

589
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're quite
formidable too, it seems.</font>

590
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:18,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Multiversal traveler.</font>

591
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thank the stars
you brought Doctor Strange to safety.</font>

592
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, just 'cause we jumped ship
doesn't mean we're safe.</font>

593
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our Wanda has the ability
to conjure demons and monsters</font>

594
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to attack America in other universes.</font>

595
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So she has the Darkhold?</font>

596
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know of the Darkhold?</font>

597
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold
in this universe, too.</font>

598
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guard it here in this Sanctum.</font>

599
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We would never
risk a weapon that dangerous</font>

600
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">falling into the wrong hands.</font>

601
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn right.</font>

602
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if your Darkhold
is anything like ours,</font>

603
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm afraid she can do far worse</font>

604
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than just summon monsters
to come after you here.</font>

605
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

606
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a spell contained
within those pages...</font>

607
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...corrosive to the soul,</font>

608
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a desecration of reality itself.</font>

609
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dreamwalking.</font>

610
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A Dreamwalking sorcerer
projects their own consciousness</font>

611
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from their universe into another,</font>

612
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">possessing the body of an alternate self.</font>

613
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They may puppeteer
this unholy doppelganger</font>

614
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and pursue their enemies from afar.</font>

615
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The possession is not a permanent link</font>

616
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between realities.</font>

617
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in the fleeting time they Dreamwalk,</font>

618
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.</font>

619
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it may not be a demon that you face.</font>

620
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may be the Scarlet Witch.</font>

621
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't she do that to begin with?</font>

622
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that
was her being reasonable.</font>

623
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you know of The Book of Vishanti?</font>

624
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Darkhold's antithesis?</font>

625
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can give a sorcerer</font>

626
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whatever power they need
to vanquish their enemy.</font>

627
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need your help
to get me to it.</font>

628
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Stephen.</font>

629
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I hope you,
of all people, understand</font>

630
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it is not Wanda Maximoff</font>

631
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who threatens our reality,</font>

632
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's the two of you.</font>

633
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, God.
- What was in that tea?</font>

634
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:41,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You son of a bitch.</font>

635
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sands of Nisanti.</font>

636
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm only acting as you would.</font>

637
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's coming.</font>

638
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boys, it's time for bed.</font>

639
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we have
a little more ice cream?</font>

640
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please.
- Please, please, please!</font>

641
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little more, please!</font>

642
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't make Mom
out to be the bad guy.</font>

643
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know who's the best?</font>

644
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who?
- 2003 Tigers.</font>

645
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They suck.</font>

646
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're so bad they suck egg.</font>

647
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they don't.
They're the best.</font>

648
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Doofus.
- Doofus 2.</font>

649
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Triple infinity doofus.</font>

650
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Infinity infinity
googolplex quadruple doofus.</font>

651
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:52,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quintuple infinity...
Crazy doofus.</font>

652
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Googolplex doofus.</font>

653
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom?</font>

654
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sweetheart?</font>

655
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

656
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just to take out the trash.</font>

657
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we show you something?</font>

658
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, hurry, come on!</font>

659
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, it's important.</font>

660
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom.</font>

661
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll like it.</font>

662
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Hurry up.</font>

663
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's important.</font>

664
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so, Mom, listen to this...</font>

665
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna start it.</font>

666
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I wanna start it.
- I wanna start it.</font>

667
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I want to start!
- No, I want to start!</font>

668
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No! I want to start.
- I want to start.</font>

669
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:29,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you both start it,</font>

670
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:33,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whatever it is, together?</font>

671
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

672
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You ready?
- Yeah.</font>

673
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3, 2, 1, go.</font>

674
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We like ice cream</font>

675
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like every child should</font>

676
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if we get some ice cream</font>

677
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We promise to be good</font>

678
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're alive.</font>

679
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

680
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But so many others were lost.</font>

681
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Set me free.</font>

682
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to destroy the book.</font>

683
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. It cannot be you.</font>

684
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sara. No, no!</font>

685
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom!</font>

686
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

687
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Are you okay?</font>

688
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Billy, Tommy.</font>

689
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:19,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

690
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:29,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

691
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need the Darkhold's spells.</font>

692
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the Sorcerer Supreme.</font>

693
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me what you know.</font>

694
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to kill me, witch.</font>

695
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not you.</font>

696
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Them.</font>

697
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, stop.</font>

698
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, please!</font>

699
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Darkhold was a copy!</font>

700
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A copy?</font>

701
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Legend speaks of a mountain</font>

702
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the wretched spells you seek
carved into its walls.</font>

703
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's there the Darkhold was transcribed.</font>

704
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mount Wundagore.</font>

705
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wundagore?</font>

706
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one has survived the journey.</font>

707
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps we will be the exception.</font>

708
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

709
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

710
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This universe sucks.</font>

711
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cloak?</font>

712
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

713
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, lab coat.</font>

714
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell are we?</font>

715
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I don't know who you are,</font>

716
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or what you think
you're trying to do here,</font>

717
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but these situations don't usually...</font>

718
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- ...work out well</font>

719
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the nameless scientists, so just...</font>

720
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christine?</font>

721
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Stephen.</font>

722
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ay Dios.</font>

723
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Chavez.</font>

724
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, to answer your question,</font>

725
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are in a highly secure
research facility.</font>

726
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The two of you,
along with your sentient cloak,</font>

727
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are here for surveillance and testing.</font>

728
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Uh, testing?</font>

729
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yes.
You're visitors from another universe.</font>

730
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your magnetic signatures
could be radioactive,</font>

731
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you may be carrying diseases
we just don't have treatments for.</font>

732
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hence, these amazing
polycarbonate fish bowls.</font>

733
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assume I have you
to thank for these then?</font>

734
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. I developed those
using the Sands of Nisanti.</font>

735
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.</font>

736
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">838 Stephen?</font>

737
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...</font>

738
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our universe is 838,</font>

739
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we've designated yours 616.</font>

740
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. You guys sure must know
a lot about the Multiverse</font>

741
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:45,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you got someone
going around naming realities.</font>

742
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

743
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

744
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a senior fellow
with the Baxter Foundation,</font>

745
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I specialize in Multiversal research.</font>

746
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So,
how'd you end up working here?</font>

747
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wherever here is.</font>

748
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I volunteered.</font>

749
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At your funeral.</font>

750
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for going.</font>

751
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your injuries, they're similar,</font>

752
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they're not identical.</font>

753
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fascinating.</font>

754
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:20,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were we to each other
in this universe?</font>

755
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We never quite figured that out.</font>

756
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

757
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's something we got in common.</font>

758
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:37,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christine, you gotta let us out of here.</font>

759
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone's in real danger.</font>

760
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know you don't know me...</font>

761
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't want to.</font>

762
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever I was to you in your universe</font>

763
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">does not matter.</font>

764
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

765
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you're dangerous, Stephen.</font>

766
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone from my universe
wants that girl,</font>

767
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's gonna rip this place
apart atom-by-atom</font>

768
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until she gets what she wants.</font>

769
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I don't care
if you're from the Avengers</font>

770
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or S.H.I.E.L.D...</font>

771
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're neither.</font>

772
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what then?</font>

773
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">HYDRA?</font>

774
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:22,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Illuminati will see you now.</font>

775
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Illumi-what-y?</font>

776
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let anyone hurt that kid.</font>

777
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be okay.</font>

778
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You couldn't portal us up there?</font>

779
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My magic can only take us so far.</font>

780
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Masters of the Mystic Arts
weren't meant to tread</font>

781
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore.</font>

782
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eons ago, the first demon, Chthon,</font>

783
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:52,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">carved his dark magic into this tomb.</font>

784
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:57,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These same spells were later transcribed
into the Darkhold.</font>

785
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no telling
what soulless monstrosities lie within.</font>

786
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've been waiting for me.</font>

787
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't a tomb.</font>

788
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a throne.</font>

789
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen Strange,</font>

790
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are now called before the Illuminati.</font>

791
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, Baron Karl Mordo,</font>

792
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Sorcerer Supreme, do hereby...</font>

793
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Karl"?</font>

794
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Carter.</font>

795
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first Avenger.</font>

796
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blackagar Boltagon.</font>

797
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:15,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keeper of the Terrigen Mists,
the Inhuman king.</font>

798
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blackagar Boltagard? Huh.</font>

799
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hidigy hidithere.</font>

800
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Marvel.
Defender of the cosmos.</font>

801
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the smartest man alive,</font>

802
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.</font>

803
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Stephen.</font>

804
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Fantastic Four."
Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?</font>

805
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?</font>

806
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's a guy over there
with a fork on his head,</font>

807
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so, yeah, a little bit.</font>

808
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't
engage you in conversation.</font>

809
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? Does he have bad breath?</font>

810
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Strange is even
more arrogant than ours.</font>

811
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hmm.
- No, just more alive.</font>

812
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For now.</font>

813
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen, your arrival here</font>

814
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">confuses and destabilizes reality.</font>

815
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The larger the footprint you leave behind,</font>

816
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the greater the risk of an Incursion.</font>

817
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incursion?</font>

818
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:03,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An Incursion occurs</font>

819
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:07,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the boundary
between two universes erodes</font>

820
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they collide,</font>

821
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:13,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">destroying one or both entirely.</font>

822
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your alternate self created the Illuminati</font>

823
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make difficult decisions
that no one else could.</font>

824
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:23,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, we're here to determine
what to do with you and the child.</font>

825
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, before we vote,</font>

826
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:28,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you got anything serious to say,
now's the time.</font>

827
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I do.</font>

828
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's Incursions you're worried about,</font>

829
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:34,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat
than the Scarlet Witch?</font>

830
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, we can handle your little witch
if she decides to Dreamwalk.</font>

831
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, you cannot.</font>

832
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not unless you give me
The Book of Vishanti.</font>

833
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We appreciate your concern, Stephen,</font>

834
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's not the Scarlet Witch
that we fear.</font>

835
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From our experience, the greatest danger</font>

836
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the Multiverse, it turns out,</font>

837
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is Doctor Strange.</font>

838
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Your Doctor Strange?</font>

839
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earth's mightiest hero
who died defeating Thanos?</font>

840
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should tell him the truth.</font>

841
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our final member,</font>

842
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Charles Xavier.</font>

843
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What truth?</font>

844
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not how our Strange died.</font>

845
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wondering what happens now.</font>

846
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

847
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That I've already accepted.</font>

848
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do wonder</font>

849
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you could force America
to send you to any universe you want,</font>

850
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why take her power for your own?</font>

851
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it would kill her.</font>

852
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.</font>

853
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if they get sick?</font>

854
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the infinite Multiverse,
there's a cure for every illness.</font>

855
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:04,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A solution to every problem.</font>

856
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:08,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't lose them again.</font>

857
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try as you might, Wanda,
you cannot control everything.</font>

858
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I can.</font>

859
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look around you.</font>

860
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's carved in stone.</font>

861
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was meant to rule everything.</font>

862
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's not what I want.</font>

863
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:30,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want my boys.</font>

864
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the cost of a child's life?</font>

865
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there no peace in knowing</font>

866
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:38,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that even though you can't be
with the ones you love,</font>

867
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there are worlds
where you are together?</font>

868
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:41,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that not enough?</font>

869
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

870
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos.</font>

871
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were at war.</font>

872
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:30,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While the rest of us banded together
to try to stop Thanos,</font>

873
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone.</font>

874
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He turned to the Darkhold,</font>

875
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">began Dreamwalking,</font>

876
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in hopes that our salvation
might lie in the Multiverse.</font>

877
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And guess what?</font>

878
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:45,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It didn't.
But he kept doing it anyway.</font>

879
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One night,
you called us all together,</font>

880
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">confessed that
you had been Dreamwalking,</font>

881
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in your words,
"Things had gotten out of hand."</font>

882
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never told us the details
of what had happened,</font>

883
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only that you had
inadvertently triggered</font>

884
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:58,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an Incursion.</font>

885
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, our friend,</font>

886
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:04,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had caused the annihilation
of another universe.</font>

887
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone in that reality died.</font>

888
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone.</font>

889
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen renounced the Darkhold's evil</font>

890
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and helped us find
The Book of Vishanti,</font>

891
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:17,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a weapon we did use together
to defeat Thanos.</font>

892
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But one final threat remained.</font>

893
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shall miss you, my friend.</font>

894
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready.</font>

895
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

896
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you tell Christine?</font>

897
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

898
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:37,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The statue...</font>

899
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:39,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the statue?</font>

900
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You built a statue.</font>

901
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world needs heroes.</font>

902
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made the difficult choice</font>

903
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because we knew what
our Strange was capable of.</font>

904
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, perhaps,</font>

905
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every Doctor Strange is capable of.</font>

906
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The building's been breached.</font>

907
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No shit, genius.</font>

908
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Status report on sentries.</font>

909
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop where you...</font>

910
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back!</font>

911
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop where you are...</font>

912
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's heading for the child.</font>

913
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch him.
We'll vote on our return.</font>

914
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:24,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen, should you manage
to escape this chamber,</font>

915
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you must guide America Chavez.</font>

916
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:28,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you saying?</font>

917
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:31,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Save the girl
and get to The Book of Vishanti.</font>

918
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You have the book here?</font>

919
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. You built a waypoint.</font>

920
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:37,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Charles, we cannot trust him.</font>

921
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe we can.</font>

922
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because someone stumbles
and loses their way</font>

923
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't mean they're lost forever.</font>

924
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:49,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will see what kind
of Doctor Strange you are.</font>

925
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:50,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

926
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perimeter breakdown.</font>

927
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All sentries engage.</font>

928
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody out.</font>

929
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Intruder approaching.
- Now!</font>

930
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Wanda.</font>

931
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ultron commands you to halt.</font>

932
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ultron commands...</font>

933
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry, hurry! She's coming!</font>

934
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

935
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:57,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, stop.</font>

936
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've possessed an innocent woman,
but you can still do the right thing.</font>

937
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her go.</font>

938
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:07,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

939
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have children of my own.
I understand your pain.</font>

940
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is their mother still alive?</font>

941
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:15,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

942
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:19,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. There will be
someone left to raise them.</font>

943
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:26,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda, Black Bolt could destroy you
with one whisper from his mouth.</font>

944
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:29,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What mouth?</font>

945
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:30,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me to The Book of Vishanti,
so that we can fight her together.</font>

946
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are in no position to give orders.</font>

947
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My vote will conclude these proceedings
when they return.</font>

948
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haven't you had enough?</font>

949
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I could do this all day.</font>

950
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the hell out of my universe!</font>

951
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not coming back.</font>

952
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:11,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you just cast your vote now
to kill your friends.</font>

953
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:16,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that that ever bothered you before.</font>

954
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:22,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you hated me
where I came from.</font>

955
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I bet secretly, my brother,</font>

956
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you hated me here.</font>

957
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must've been so jealous.</font>

958
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:28,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what?</font>

959
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:31,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you were thrilled
when you heard I'd been corrupted.</font>

960
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, you probably gave me
the Darkhold to begin with...</font>

961
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know nothing of this universe!</font>

962
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:38,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that killing Stephen Strange
was your ticket to getting the Sanctum,</font>

963
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:40,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to becoming Sorcerer Supreme,</font>

964
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and to joining
your little circus of clowns,</font>

965
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Illuminati.</font>

966
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready...</font>

967
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to cast my vote now.</font>

968
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm beginning to understand</font>

969
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why your Mordo
didn't like you very much!</font>

970
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're sealed shut!</font>

971
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Get back.</font>

972
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

973
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough!</font>

974
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:32,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me. Please.</font>

975
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda Maximoff,
your mind is being held hostage</font>

976
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:36,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by your alternate self.</font>

977
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab my hand.</font>

978
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:45,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps, if I can pull you
from under the rubble,</font>

979
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the spell will break.</font>

980
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! You all right?</font>

981
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:37,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

982
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:40,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

983
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You all right?
- Yeah.</font>

984
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

985
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She fixed him.</font>

986
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Yeah.</font>

987
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:52,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Xavier said I built a waypoint
to The Book of Vishanti.</font>

988
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:53,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you take us there?</font>

989
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How am I supposed to trust you?</font>

990
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what happened,
and I'm sorry for what he did,</font>

991
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but believe me,
The Book of Vishanti is the only way.</font>

992
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:00,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Your way.</font>

993
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:03,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sound a lot
like my Stephen right now.</font>

994
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had to be the one holding the knife,</font>

995
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:07,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then that knife
killed a trillion people.</font>

996
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:08,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This Stephen is different.</font>

997
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is.</font>

998
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter
about all the other Stephens.</font>

999
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not like them.</font>

1000
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:20,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smart kid.</font>

1001
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:25,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your hand.</font>

1002
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not make me regret this.</font>

1003
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:33,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't.</font>

1004
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, can we go now?
- Yeah, follow me.</font>

1005
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:52,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's that tunnel go?</font>

1006
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:54,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Under the river.</font>

1007
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go, go, go!</font>

1008
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did she go?</font>

1009
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I warned you.</font>

1010
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Other Wanda, if you're in there,</font>

1011
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:26,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hold your breath.</font>

1012
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you kill her?
- No, just bought us some time.</font>

1013
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Book's through here.</font>

1014
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But only Stephen's ever opened it.</font>

1015
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:54,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1016
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An enchantment
that's specific to me,</font>

1017
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">something only I would know.</font>

1018
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait. Stephen.
- Come on.</font>

1019
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1020
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen.</font>

1021
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:13,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1022
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:17,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1023
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:19,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1024
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:26,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open sesame.</font>

1025
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, kid.</font>

1026
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got this.</font>

1027
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got this.</font>

1028
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:08,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1029
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right?</font>

1030
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:18,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1031
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:24,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the Gap Junction,
the space between universes.</font>

1032
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:39,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Book.</font>

1033
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me what I need.</font>

1034
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1035
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My boys.</font>

1036
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't what your children would want.</font>

1037
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:28,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll never know.</font>

1038
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe not.</font>

1039
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:31,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you will.</font>

1040
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:36,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

1041
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, crap.</font>

1042
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like this reality
collapsed in on itself.</font>

1043
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:44,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1044
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:47,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or two realities collided.</font>

1045
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:48,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1046
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:50,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America doesn't have long.</font>

1047
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where are we going?</font>

1048
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:54,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
if there's still a sanctum</font>

1049
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:55,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in this universe,</font>

1050
01:26:57,086 --> 01:27:00,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then there might be
another Other Other Me,</font>

1051
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:03,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that's our best shot
of getting back to her.</font>

1052
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:19,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I can see why you guys
were so worried about Incursions.</font>

1053
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever happened,</font>

1054
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this universe's you
didn't do a very good job</font>

1055
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of stopping it.</font>

1056
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:39,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell him you said that.</font>

1057
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:40,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1058
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop where you are.</font>

1059
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get here?</font>

1060
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:56,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By accident.</font>

1061
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

1062
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:01,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you?</font>

1063
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just one of us.</font>

1064
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the Multiverse?</font>

1065
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:06,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

1066
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prove it.</font>

1067
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a sister.</font>

1068
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:16,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Donna.</font>

1069
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:19,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she, um...</font>

1070
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She died when we were kids.</font>

1071
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How?</font>

1072
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:33,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were playing
on a frozen lake and, uh...</font>

1073
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she fell through the ice.</font>

1074
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:47,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't save her.</font>

1075
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:51,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds about right.</font>

1076
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:56,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we don't talk about that, do we?</font>

1077
01:29:58,309 --> 01:29:59,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we don't.</font>

1078
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:03,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suppose your reality
wasn't always like this.</font>

1079
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:06,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suspect it was
somewhat like yours until...</font>

1080
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:07,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until?</font>

1081
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until I lost.</font>

1082
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:13,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To whom?</font>

1083
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

1084
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to get home.</font>

1085
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Believe me,</font>

1086
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been trying to leave
this place for a long time.</font>

1087
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:29,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darkhold.</font>

1088
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guard the Darkhold in this universe?</font>

1089
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:33,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1090
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For good reason.</font>

1091
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:36,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a start.</font>

1092
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:37,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could use it.</font>

1093
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:39,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could help me to communicate
with my universe.</font>

1094
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:40,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful.</font>

1095
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:44,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.</font>

1096
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't mean to be callous,</font>

1097
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:50,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but how much of a heavier toll
is there left to exact?</font>

1098
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just on its reality.</font>

1099
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On its reader.</font>

1100
01:30:55,491 --> 01:30:57,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm sorry you couldn't
save your universe,</font>

1101
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but maybe you could help
to save mine.</font>

1102
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:05,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you happy, Stephen?</font>

1103
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1104
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:12,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you happy, Stephen?</font>

1105
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:16,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the question that...</font>

1106
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:19,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Christine Palmer</font>

1107
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:22,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">asked me at her wedding.</font>

1108
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, "Yes, of course I'm happy.</font>

1109
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.</font>

1110
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:32,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"What man wouldn't be happy?"</font>

1111
01:31:33,696 --> 01:31:38,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I came back
to this goddamn haunted house,</font>

1112
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:40,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sat down,</font>

1113
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:44,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and wondered why I'd lied.</font>

1114
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:49,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never meant for any of this to happen.</font>

1115
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:54,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was looking for a world
where things were different.</font>

1116
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:59,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where I had Christine,
where I was happy.</font>

1117
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:03,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I didn't find it.</font>

1118
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I found were more of us.</font>

1119
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I did those Stephens a favor.</font>

1120
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever had that dream
where you're falling</font>

1121
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:19,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as if you've been pushed off
a tall building?</font>

1122
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was probably me.</font>

1123
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:35,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.</font>

1124
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:37,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1125
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the more reason to give it a rest
and let me have it.</font>

1126
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:42,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the deal.</font>

1127
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:45,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll let you use the Darkhold</font>

1128
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:47,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you give me your Christine.</font>

1129
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:49,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1130
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:51,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think she's gonna go for that.</font>

1131
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:52,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

1132
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't think so.</font>

1133
01:36:23,194 --> 01:36:24,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, we're coming.</font>

1134
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:32,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing with the Darkhold?</font>

1135
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:36,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you going to Dreamwalk?</font>

1136
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a little bit more
than just Dreamwalking.</font>

1137
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:41,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you Stranges, you're the same.</font>

1138
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:43,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1139
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:46,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right.</font>

1140
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are all the same.</font>

1141
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:50,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But right now, that kid needs me.</font>

1142
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:54,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I can't do any of this
without your help.</font>

1143
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:56,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">While I'm under,</font>

1144
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:58,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to protect my body</font>

1145
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in case they attack me for trespassing.</font>

1146
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:01,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's "they"?</font>

1147
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The souls of the damned.</font>

1148
01:37:27,967 --> 01:37:28,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1149
01:37:29,134 --> 01:37:33,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But doesn't a version of you
need to live in that universe,</font>

1150
01:37:33,305 --> 01:37:35,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that you can Dreamwalk into them?</font>

1151
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said they had to be living?</font>

1152
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:54,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen Strange,</font>

1153
01:38:54,386 --> 01:38:57,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">possessing a dead body is forbidden.</font>

1154
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:58,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forbidden.</font>

1155
01:38:58,974 --> 01:39:00,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trespasser!</font>

1156
01:39:00,559 --> 01:39:02,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trespasser!</font>

1157
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cease your Dreamwalk,
or face the eternal consequences.</font>

1158
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:17,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen!</font>

1159
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:20,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're pulling me down.</font>

1160
01:39:21,747 --> 01:39:22,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen!</font>

1161
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:32,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, hang on, hang on.</font>

1162
01:39:33,008 --> 01:39:34,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you?</font>

1163
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:02,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Brazier of Bom'Galiath.</font>

1164
01:40:13,298 --> 01:40:14,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go back to hell.</font>

1165
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen.</font>

1166
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:30,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got you.</font>

1167
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:34,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a Master of the Mystic Arts.</font>

1168
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're spirits.</font>

1169
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:37,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use them.</font>

1170
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:43,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use them.</font>

1171
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:47,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use them.</font>

1172
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1173
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1174
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:06,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh.</font>

1175
01:42:35,023 --> 01:42:37,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange!</font>

1176
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!</font>

1177
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:56,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This time, it's gonna take
more than killing me</font>

1178
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:57,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to kill me.</font>

1179
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:08,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Murderer! Murderer!</font>

1180
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:22,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even wanna know.</font>

1181
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:38,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1182
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:39,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- No!</font>

1183
01:43:39,588 --> 01:43:41,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's breaking free!</font>

1184
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:42,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold her!</font>

1185
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange, take America's power!</font>

1186
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:53,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no other way.</font>

1187
01:43:53,977 --> 01:43:54,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1188
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the only way.</font>

1189
01:44:09,868 --> 01:44:12,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me in Other Me's body.</font>

1190
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're here to take my power,
aren't you?</font>

1191
01:44:20,254 --> 01:44:21,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before Wanda can.</font>

1192
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:24,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1193
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:27,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand now.</font>

1194
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:34,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, America.</font>

1195
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:37,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've come here to tell you
to trust yourself.</font>

1196
01:44:37,479 --> 01:44:39,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust your power.</font>

1197
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how we stop her.</font>

1198
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't control it. I...</font>

1199
01:44:43,568 --> 01:44:45,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you can.</font>

1200
01:44:45,737 --> 01:44:47,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have been all along.</font>

1201
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:49,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every time you opened a portal,</font>

1202
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:52,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you sent us
exactly where we needed to go.</font>

1203
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:56,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the first time?</font>

1204
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even that led you to this moment...</font>

1205
01:45:00,752 --> 01:45:03,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you're gonna kick that witch's ass.</font>

1206
01:45:25,986 --> 01:45:27,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got you.</font>

1207
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:53,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh.</font>

1208
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:55,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-mm-mm.</font>

1209
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't beat you.</font>

1210
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'll give you what you want.</font>

1211
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:38,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy. Tommy.</font>

1212
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:41,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy!
It's the witch!</font>

1213
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:42,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you done?</font>

1214
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:44,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom!
- Mommy!</font>

1215
01:46:44,189 --> 01:46:45,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Boys!</font>

1216
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:46,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.</font>

1217
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm your mother!</font>

1218
01:46:50,612 --> 01:46:52,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get away from them.</font>

1219
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:54,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom!</font>

1220
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1221
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:57,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet.</font>

1222
01:46:58,078 --> 01:46:59,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy!</font>

1223
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:01,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get away from our mom!
- You're not our real mom!</font>

1224
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:03,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, boys. Stop. Please.</font>

1225
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please. Boys, stop it.
- Get out of our house!</font>

1226
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:06,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not our mom!
- Get out!</font>

1227
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:07,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Go away!
- Go!</font>

1228
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:09,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it!</font>

1229
01:47:17,722 --> 01:47:19,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't hurt us.</font>

1230
01:47:20,142 --> 01:47:21,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1231
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:23,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would never hurt you.</font>

1232
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:25,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>

1233
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would never hurt anyone.</font>

1234
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:30,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not a monster.</font>

1235
01:47:31,069 --> 01:47:32,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a...</font>

1236
01:47:36,199 --> 01:47:37,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm...</font>

1237
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:46,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1238
01:47:54,426 --> 01:47:55,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom!</font>

1239
01:47:55,677 --> 01:47:57,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- Hi.</font>

1240
01:47:58,263 --> 01:47:59,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Okay.</font>

1241
01:47:59,764 --> 01:48:00,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm okay.</font>

1242
01:48:01,641 --> 01:48:04,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm okay. I'm okay.</font>

1243
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:17,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom, don't go. Don't go.
- No, Mom. Don't.</font>

1244
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:19,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's okay.
- Mom.</font>

1245
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:21,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay.</font>

1246
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:04,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know that they'll be loved.</font>

1247
01:49:45,161 --> 01:49:46,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What now?</font>

1248
01:49:46,329 --> 01:49:47,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here.</font>

1249
01:49:48,415 --> 01:49:49,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll find you.</font>

1250
01:49:58,383 --> 01:50:00,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to go. Now!</font>

1251
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:14,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I opened the Darkhold.</font>

1252
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:17,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to close it.</font>

1253
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:23,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one will ever be tempted
by the Darkhold again.</font>

1254
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:09,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all right?</font>

1255
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:11,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it over?
- Yeah.</font>

1256
01:51:12,415 --> 01:51:13,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is America okay?</font>

1257
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:15,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's on her way here to get us.</font>

1258
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanda?</font>

1259
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:22,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1260
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:33,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So she destroyed the Darkhold
in every universe.</font>

1261
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:38,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did the right thing.</font>

1262
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, she did.</font>

1263
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:51,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your universe like?</font>

1264
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:55,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's very beautiful.
- Hmm.</font>

1265
01:51:59,754 --> 01:52:01,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish I could show you.</font>

1266
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:06,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd really like that.</font>

1267
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:14,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But I have to go.
- Yeah.</font>

1268
01:52:15,645 --> 01:52:16,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know.</font>

1269
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:22,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too bad, though.</font>

1270
01:52:24,362 --> 01:52:26,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could've been one hell of an Incursion.</font>

1271
01:52:29,993 --> 01:52:31,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1272
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:37,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you in every universe.</font>

1273
01:52:41,045 --> 01:52:42,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not that
I don't wanna care for someone</font>

1274
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:44,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or have someone care for me.</font>

1275
01:52:44,507 --> 01:52:45,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just...</font>

1276
01:52:49,053 --> 01:52:50,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get scared.</font>

1277
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:51,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1278
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:56,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1279
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:08,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Face your fears...</font>

1280
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:13,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor Strange.</font>

1281
01:53:43,024 --> 01:53:45,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ay! How is this so much harder</font>

1282
01:53:45,235 --> 01:53:46,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than a Multiversal portal?</font>

1283
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:51,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She needs to slow down
and be more patient.</font>

1284
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:55,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reminds me of another student I knew.</font>

1285
01:53:57,622 --> 01:53:58,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you feeling?</font>

1286
01:53:59,582 --> 01:54:00,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you ask?</font>

1287
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used the Darkhold
to Dreamwalk into your own corpse.</font>

1288
01:54:05,588 --> 01:54:06,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1289
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, right, that.</font>

1290
01:54:09,175 --> 01:54:10,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

1291
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:14,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do wanna ask you something.</font>

1292
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:17,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you happy?</font>

1293
01:54:18,643 --> 01:54:20,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a, um,</font>

1294
01:54:20,478 --> 01:54:21,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">interesting question.</font>

1295
01:54:23,356 --> 01:54:26,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd think that saving the world
would get you there,</font>

1296
01:54:26,776 --> 01:54:27,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it doesn't.</font>

1297
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:35,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes, I do wonder
about my other lives.</font>

1298
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:39,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet I remain grateful in this one.</font>

1299
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even with its tribulations.</font>

1300
01:54:44,085 --> 01:54:46,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least we don't have to
go through it alone, huh?</font>

1301
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:48,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we don't.</font>

1302
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:56,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1303
01:54:59,267 --> 01:55:01,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

1304
01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:04,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Sup?</font>

1305
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:05,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Sup.</font>

1306
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Made some sparks.</font>

1307
01:55:08,943 --> 01:55:09,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>

1308
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your parents would be proud.</font>

1309
01:55:12,155 --> 01:55:14,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you'll get to show 'em one day.</font>

1310
01:55:15,366 --> 01:55:16,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen.</font>

1311
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:23,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad I fell into your universe.</font>

1312
01:55:25,293 --> 01:55:26,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So am I, kid.</font>

1313
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:29,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So am I.</font>

1314
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:06,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1315
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:57,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor Strange?</font>

1316
01:59:00,424 --> 01:59:01,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you?</font>

1317
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You caused an Incursion,</font>

1318
01:59:03,886 --> 01:59:05,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're gonna fix it.</font>

1319
01:59:14,188 --> 01:59:15,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you're afraid.</font>

1320
01:59:20,528 --> 01:59:21,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not in the least.</font>

1321
02:06:13,357 --> 02:06:14,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over!</font>
