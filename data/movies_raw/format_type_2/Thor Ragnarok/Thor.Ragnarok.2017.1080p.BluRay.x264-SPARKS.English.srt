I'm kind of like

I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

But don't let that
intimidate you.

704
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,323
You don't need to be afraid

705
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,950

made of scissors. (CHUCKLES)

He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

You're a Kronan, aren't you?

711
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,134
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

712
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,094
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

713
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,216
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

714
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,881
So hardly anyone turned up,

715
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,558
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

716
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,180
As punishment, I was forced

717
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,638
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

718
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,143
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

719
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,066
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

720
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,351
I don't know
if you'd be interested

721
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,482
in something like that.

722
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,234
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

723
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,524
How did you...

724
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,368
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

725
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,701
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

726
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,203
This doesn't make any sense.

727
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,579
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

728
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,202
The only thing
that does make sense

729
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,662
is that nothing makes sense.

730
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,214
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

731
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,498
Doug has.

732
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,666
Doug!

733
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,917
Our luck, Doug's dead.

734
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,002
That's right.

735
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,261
Everyone who fights

736
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:28,428
the Grandmaster's champion
perishes.

737
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,427
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

738
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,222
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

739
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,303
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

740
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,229
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

741
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,140
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

742
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,729
Yes, I am.

743
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,811
Gonna fight him, win,

744
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,191
and get the hell out
of this place.

745
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,689
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

746
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,741
See you later, new Doug.

747
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,286
Does no one remember me?

748
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,332
Has no one been taught
our history?

749
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,471
Look at these lies.

750
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,640
Goblets and garden parties?

751
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,556

753
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,348
proud to have it...

754
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,892
ashamed of how he got it.

756
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,455
We were unstoppable.

757
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,461
I was his weapon
in the conquest

758
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,009
that built Asgard's empire.

759
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,178
One by one,
the realms became ours.

760
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:58,519
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

761
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:03,354
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

762
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,398
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

763

beneath this very palace.

it would be.

Being told you're one thing

789
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,340
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,181
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

Look, I couldn't jeopardize my

you could join me

Hammer?

844
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,190

special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

really fast,

00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,862
it gave me the ability to fly.

on your back?

851

No. I used to spin it
really fast,

852
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,753
and it would pull me
off the...

Oh, my God.

off the ground,

up into the air,
and I would fly.

01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:16,775
I just need you to stay calm.

1424
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,864
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1425
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,775
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1426
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:21,905
Yeah. One.

1427
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,781
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1428
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,195
It's a new experience.

1429
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,327
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1430
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:29,408
than my brain can handle
the information.

1431
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,831
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1432
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,837
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1433
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,209
each had a hand on the wheel.

1434
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,254
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

1435
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,880
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1436
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:40,924
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1437
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:42,175
No, it's not what matters.

1438
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,426
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1439
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,052
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1440
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,676
Banner may never come back.

1441
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,184
And we're stranded on a planet

1442
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,012
that is designed
to stress me out.

1443
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,221
We're not stranded.

1444
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,648
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1445
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,183
Thank you.

1446
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,518
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1447
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:57,899
What?

1448
01:20:58,145 --> 01:20:59,738
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1449
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,487
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1450
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,485
who also happens
to be my sister.

1451
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,408
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1452
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:07,704
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1453
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,032
That's a family issue.

1454
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,408
No, she's an evil being.

1455
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,289
I don't care what she is.

1456
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,541
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1457
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:15,788
- What?
- I just told you.

1458
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,623
If I turn into the Hulk,

1459
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:18,878
I am never gonna
come back again.

1460
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,130
And you don't care.

1461
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,010
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

1462
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,511
The Hulk is the fire.

1463
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,469
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1464
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,136
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1465
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,056
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1466
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,053
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1467
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,388
He's all like...

1468
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,976
"Smash, smash, smash."

1469
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,224
I prefer you.

1470
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,142
Thanks.

1471
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,520
But if I'm being honest,

1472
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,980
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1473
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,527
he is very powerful
and useful.

1474
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,654
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1475
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,034
Is he though?

1476
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,320
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1477
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,281
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1478
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,117
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1479
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,165
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1480
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,336
What are you doing with that?

1481
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:01,500
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1482
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,256
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1483
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,596
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1484
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,556
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1485
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,259
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1486
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:11,726
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1487
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:12,970
Because you were naked.

1488
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,263
Okay, I'll give you that.

1489
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,397
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1490
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:17,850
Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1491
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:18,934
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1492
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,270
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1493
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,815
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1494
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:26,445
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1495
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,364
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,382
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

1595
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:16,630
There are one or two ships.

1596
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:17,714
Absolute top of the line
models...

1597
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,178

(GLASS SHATTERS)

1599
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,183
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

1600
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,265
I may even have stolen

1601
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,316
the access codes
to his security system.

1602
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,601
And suddenly you're overcome

1603
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:30,777
with an urge
to do the right thing.

1604
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:32,062
Heavens, no.

1605
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,772
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

1606
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,698
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

1607
01:26:35,982 --> 01:26:39,031
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1608
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:40,746
You're telling us
that you can get us

1609
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:41,947
access into the garage...

1610
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,657
without setting off
any alarms?

1611
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,663
Yes, brother. I can.

1612
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:48,583
Okay, can I just... (WHISTLES)
A quick FYI.

1613
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,463
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1614
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,084
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1615
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,425
He did try to kill me.

1616
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,428
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1617
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:58,180
There was one time
when we were children...

1618
01:26:58,422 --> 01:26:59,890
he transformed himself
into a snake,

1619
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,091
and he knows
that I love snakes.

1620
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,093
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1621
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,765
and he transformed back
into himself

1622
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:05,971
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

1623
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,100
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

boosting a ship...

1625
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:12,478

guards away from the palace.

1626
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,025
Why not set the beast loose?

1627
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,230
Shut up.

1628
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,481
You guys have a beast?

1629
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,988
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1630
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:20,694
We're going to start
a revolution.

1631
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:22,245
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

1632

- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

1633
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,327
Is that
some sort of protoplasm,

that's coming out of you...

1635
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:30,875
or are they eggs?

1636
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:33,498
Looks like eggs.

I know you're asking.

Is anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

1649
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,744

have armed themselves.

Oh. I don't like that word.

1651
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,334
Which? Mainframe?

1652
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:12,579
No. Why would I not like
"mainframe"?

No, the "S" word.

1654

have armed themselves.

was never our family's forte.

You have no idea.

1661

since we last spoke.

Hello.

Hi.

Odin brought us together.

1665
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,958
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

1666
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,087
We might as well be
strangers now.

I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

That's exactly
what I was thinking.

so little of me?

the world of you.

I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

you're you and I'm me.

there's still good in you.

see each other again.
