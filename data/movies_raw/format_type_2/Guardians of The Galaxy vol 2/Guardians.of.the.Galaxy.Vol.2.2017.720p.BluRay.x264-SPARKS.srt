Come on!
Slow down!

00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,042
This way, my river lily!
Come on!

10
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,358
Where are you taking me?

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,478
Come on, come on.

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,618
Look. Look!

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,038
Oh, it's beautiful!

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,238
I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil,

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,718
but it rooted quickly.

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,522
And soon, it'll be everywhere.

17
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,676
All across the universe.

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,038
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,578
but I like the way you say it.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,991
My heart is yours,

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,904
Meredith Quill.

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,498
I can't believe I fell in love with a spaceman.

23
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,438
Showtime, a-holes!

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,036
It will be here any minute.

25
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,958
Which will be its loss.

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,198
I thought your thing was a sword?

27
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,283
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast

28
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,010
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

29
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,398
It's just, swords were your
thing and guns were mine, but...

30
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,158
I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,878
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

32
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,278
It hurts.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,167
It hurts?

34
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,573
I have sensitive nipples.

35
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,478
My nipples hurt!
Oh, goodness me!

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,238
What about him?
What's he doing?

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,918
I'm finishing this so we can
listen to tunes while we work.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,318
How is that a priority?

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,838
Blame Quill.
He's the one who loves music so much.

40
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,598
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,158
That's hardly important right now.

42
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,678
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,218
No, seriously.

44
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:00,662
I side with Drax.

45
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,318
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

46
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,658
I can clearly see you winking.

47
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,838
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

48
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,398
I am Groot.

49
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,720
They were not looking at you funny.

50
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,804
Well, that's intense.

51
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,201
Groot!

52
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,678
Groot, get out of the way!
You're gonna get hurt!

53
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,081
Hi.

54
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,958
No Groot! Spit it out! Spit it out!

55
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,021
Come on!

56
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,531
Disgusting!

57
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,458
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

58
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,518
I must cut through it from the inside.

59
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,198
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

60
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,008
Drax!

61
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,158
What is he doing?

62
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,238
He said the skin is too thick to be
pierced from the outside, so he

63
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,238
That doesn't make any sense!
I tried telling him that!

64
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,918
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

65
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,378
I realize that.

66
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,069
There is a cut on its neck.

67
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,729
Rocket, get it to look up.

68
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,918
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey!
Up here!

69
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,198
Watch it, Quill!

70
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:24,164
Yes! I have single-handedly
vanquished the beast!

71
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,261
What?

72
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,789
What are they called again?

73
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,838
Anulax batteries.

74
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,198
Harbulary batteries.

75
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,378
That's nothing like what I just said.

76
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,518
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece

77
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,678
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.

78
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,911
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.

79
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:56,004
The cost of transgression is death.

80
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,240
We thank you Guardians,

81
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,838
for putting your lives on the line.

82
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,745
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.

83
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:10,318
Every citizen is born exactly
as designed by the community.

84
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,838
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.

85
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,178
We control the DNA of our progeny
germinating them in birthing pods.

86
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,262
I guess I prefer to make
people the old-fashioned way.

87
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:23,304
Perhaps...

88
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:26,258
Perhaps someday, you could give
me a history lesson

89
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,378
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

90
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,758
For academic purposes.

91
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,918
I would be honored, yes.

92
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,378
In the name of research,

93
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,114
I think that could be pretty...

94
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,703
pretty repulsive.

95
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,478
I'm not into that kind of casual...

96
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,678
Oh, please.

97
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,158
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

98
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,767
Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way.

99
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,558
Family reunion.

100
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,358
I understand she is your sister.

101
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,438
She's worth no more to me than
the bounty due for her on Xandar.

102
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,104
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

103
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,878
Do with her as you please.

104
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,838
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

105
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,411
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

106
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,238
My mother is from Earth.

107
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,169
And your father?

108
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,189
He ain't from Missouri.

109
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:40,758
That's all I know.

110
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,291
I see it within you.

111
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,578
An unorthodox genealogy.

112
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,110
A hybrid that seems particularly,

113
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,770
reckless.

114
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,896
You know,

115
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:57,387
they told me you people
were conceited douchebags,

116
00:11:57,977 --> 00:11:59,588
but that isn't true at all.

117
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,918
Oh, shit.

118
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,962
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?

119
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:09,023
I'm sorry. That...

120
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:11,003
That was meant to be behind your back.

121
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:14,318
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

122
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,606
You're telling me.

123
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,747
You wanna buy some batteries?

124
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,678
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar

125
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,125
and collect that bounty.

126
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,478
That stuff about my father.

127
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,538
Who does she think she is?

128
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,018
I know you're sensitive about that.

129
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

130
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,158
Sorry if it seemed like I was
flirting with the High Priestess.

131
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,737
I wasn't.

132
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,378
I don't care if you were.

133
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,739
Well, I feel like you do care.

134
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,657
That's why I'm apologizing.

135
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,878
So, sorry!

136
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,062
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

137
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,960
Damn shadow.

138
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,078
There are two types
of beings in the universe.

139
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,189
Those who dance,

140
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:57,662
and those who do not.

141
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,598
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

142
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,678
Oh, God.

143
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,678
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.

144
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,198
Except one woman.

145
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,045
My Ovette.

146
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,198
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.

147
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,746
The most melodic song in
the world could be playing.

148
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,567
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

149
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,078
Wouldn't move a muscle.

150
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,158
One might assume she was dead.

151
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,458
That does sound pretty hot.

152
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,358
It would make my nether regions engorge.

153
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,998
Okay. I get it, yes.

154
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,478
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

155
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,305
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic like you.

156
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:36,329
Ok?

157
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,725
I'm hungry.

158
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:44,459
Hand me some of that Yaro root.

159
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,158
No. It's not ripe yet

160
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,260
and I hate you.

161
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:48,638
You hate me?

162
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,318
You left me there while you
stole that stone for yourself.

163
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,698
And yet here you stand, a hero.

164
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,018
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.

165
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,478
I swear.

166
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
No.

167
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,018
You're gonna live out the rest
of your days in a prison on Xandar,

168
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,238
wishing you could.

169
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,717
This is weird. We've got a Sovereign
fleet approaching from the rear.

170
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,612
Why would they do that?

171
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,518
Probably because Rocket
stole some of their batteries.

172
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Dude!

173
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,070
Right.

174
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:21,458
He didn't steal some of those.

175
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,518
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

176
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,028
What were you thinking?

177
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:37,757
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

178
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,358
That's your defense?
Come on!

179
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,798
You saw how that High
Priestess talked down to us.

180
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,429
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

181
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,078
Oh, I didn't realize your
motivation was altruism.

182
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,598
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions

183
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,658
and they're trying to kill us.
Exactly!

184
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,378
I was being sarcastic!

185
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,097
Oh, no!
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice!

186
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,578
Now I look foolish!

187
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,878
Can we put the bickering on hold until
after we survive this massive space battle?

188
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,678
More incoming!
Good!

189
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,238
I wanna kill some guys!

190
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,558
You're not killing anyone.

191
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,085
All those ships are remotely piloted.

192
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,718
Damn it!

193
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:32,018
What is the delay, Admiral?

194
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,276
High Priestess,

195
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:36,086
the batteries, they are
exceptionally combustible

196
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,708
and could destroy the entire fleet.

197
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:40,611
Our concern is their
slight against our people.

198
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,349
We hired them and they steal from us.

199
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,425
It is heresy of the highest order.

200
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,578
All command modules,

201
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,686
fire with the intent to kill.

202
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,809
What's the nearest habitable planet?

203
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,298
It's called Berhert.

204
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,198
How many jumps?
Only one.

205
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,758
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

206
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,204
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

207
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:26,123
Quill, to make it through that

208
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:28,048
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.

209
00:17:28,151 --> 00:17:29,218
Lucky for us.

210
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:30,685
I am.
I...

211
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,277
What are you doing?

212
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,478
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

213
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,659
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

214
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,345
You were cybernetically
engineered to be a douchebag!

215
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,445
Stop it.

216
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:55,839
Well, later on tonight you're
gonna be laying down in your bed

217
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,998
and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillow case.

218
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,438
And you're gonna be like, what's this?

219
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,881
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!

220
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:05,318
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

221
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,058
Oh, it won't be my turd.

222
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,538
It will be Drax's.

223
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,918
I have famously huge turds.

224
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,526
We're about to die, 
and this is what we're discussing?

225
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,198
Son of a...

226
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,198
Dude! Seriously!

227
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,358
Hey! Let me.

228
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,158
Idiots!

229
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,658
Well, that's what you get when Quill flies.

230
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,727
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

231
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,238
Our weapons are down.

232
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,722
20 clicks to the jump!

233
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,820
Hold on.

234
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,428
It's not ripe.

235
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,202
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

236
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,904
Yes!

237
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,477
15 clicks to the jump!

238
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,206
Come on!

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,490
Keep going!

240
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,926
10 clicks!

241
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,329
Die, spaceship!

242
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,558
You suck, Zylak.

243
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Typical.

244
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,247
Five clicks!

245
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,778
Son of a...

246
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,923
They went around the field!

247
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:28,338
Someone destroyed all our ships!

248
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,780
What?

249
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Who?

250
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,045
One click!

251
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:38,915
What is that?

252
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,118
Who cares?
That's the jump point! Go! Go!

253
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,529
It's a guy.

254
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,438
Oh, my God.

255
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,685
He's still out there?

256
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,601
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

257
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,041
Prepare for a really bad landing!

258
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,528
That was awesome!

259
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,221
Yes!

260
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,366
Look at this!

261
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,878
Where is the other half of our ship?

262
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,039
My ship.

263
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,870
Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field

264
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:27,318
had you flown with what's between your
ears instead of what's between your legs!

265
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,318
If what's between my legs 
had a hand on it

266
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,413
I guarantee I could have landed 
this ship with it.

267
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,718
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.

268
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:38,238
More like because he stole

269
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,478
the Anulax batteries!

270
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,958
They're called Harbulary batteries.

271
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,499
No, they're not!

272
00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:45,897
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

273
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,798
I'm not gonna answer to Star-Munch.

274
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,878
I did it because I wanted to!

275
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,718
Dick.

276
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,758
What are we even talking about this for?

277
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,398
We just had a little man save
us by blowing up 50 ships!

278
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,438
How little?

279
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,838
Well, I don't know, like this?

280
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,638
A little one-inch man saved us?

281
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,958
Well, if he got closer, 
I'm sure he would be much larger.

282
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,478
That's how eyesight works, 
you stupid raccoon.

283
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,198
Don't call me a raccoon!

284
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,646
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

285
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,883
I meant trash panda.

286
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,398
Is that better?

287
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,118
I don't know.

288
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,118
It's worse. It's so much worse.

289
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,418
You son of a...

290
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,398
Hey!

291
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,043
I've had it with you!
No! Back up!

292
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:25,985
Someone followed
you through the jump point.

293
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,138
Set me free, you'll need my help.

294
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,518
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

295
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,358
You are a fool if you deprive
yourself a hand in combat.

296
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,718
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

297
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,878
No, I won't.

298
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,218
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

299
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,088
I bet it's the one-inch man.

300
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,686
After all these years, I've found you.

301
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,270
And who the hell are you?

302
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,483
I figured my rugged good
looks would make that obvious.

303
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,582
My name is Ego,

304
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,968
and I'm your dad, Peter.

305
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,458
You know what they say.

306
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,230
You're out of luck until you've gone duck.

307
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,931
Yondu!

308
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,608
Come on down!

309
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,558
After going around years in circles

310
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,638
with this woman I end up marrying.

311
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,438
I said, Aleta, I love you, girl

312
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,038
but you're losing your mind!

313
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,158
Then again, she's always been that way.

314
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,118
I could never trust her. You know?

315
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,121
Stakar.

316
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,889
It's been some time.

317
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,205
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

318
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,398
Sir!
Stakar!

319
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,798
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

320
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,118
You lost the business of 99 
of them by serving one.

321
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,509
Please, sir.

322
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,080
Please! Please!
Get away from me.

323
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,918
You can go to hell then!

324
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,038
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

325
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,662
So what are you following us for?

326
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,417
Because you're gonna
listen to what I gotta say!

327
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:33,037
I don't gotta listen to nothing!

328
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,518
You betrayed the code!

329
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,518
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

330
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,858
I told you before!

331
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:39,518
I didn't know what was going on!

332
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,238
You didn't know because you didn't
want to know because it made you rich.

333
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,478
I demand a seat at the table!

334
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,718
I wear these flames, same as you.

335
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,186
You may dress like us,

336
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:51,238
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

337
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,478
And the Colors of Ogord,

338
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,902
will never flash over your grave.

339
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,691
If you think,

340
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,413
I take pleasure,

341
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,267
in exiling you,

342
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,110
you're wrong.

343
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,070
You broke all our hearts.

344
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,261
Pathetic.

345
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,838
First, Quill betrays us

346
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,128
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

347
00:27:35,831 --> 00:27:37,022
We followed him,

348
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:38,333
because he was the one

349
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:40,838
who wasn't afraid to do
what needed to be done.

350
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,478
Seems he's going soft.

351
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,717
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?

352
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,078
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

353
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,678
You best be very careful what
you say about our captain.

354
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,250
Who the hell is that?

355
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,064
Yondu Udonta.

356
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,958
I have a proposition for you.

357
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,829
I hired Yondu to pick you up

358
00:28:42,832 --> 00:28:44,838
when your mother passed away.

359
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,638
But instead of returning you,

360
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,498
Yondu kept you.

361
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,406
I have no clue as to why.

362
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,058
Well, I'll tell you why.

363
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,318
Because I was a skinny little kid who
could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

364
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,998
It made it easier for thieving.

365
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,517
Well, I've been trying
to track you down ever since.

366
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,558
I thought Yondu was your father.

367
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,320
What?

368
00:29:05,645 --> 00:29:09,458
We've been together this whole time you
thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?

369
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,158
You look exactly alike.

370
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,810
One's blue!

371
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,238
No, he's not my father!

372
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,417
Yondu was the guy who abducted me

373
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,838
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight

374
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,998
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.

375
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,518
Eat you?
Yeah.

376
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,478
Oh, that son of a bitch.

377
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,145
How'd you locate us now?

378
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,038
Well, even where I reside, out
past the edge of what's known

379
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,598
we've heard tell about the
man they call Star-Lord.

380
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,673
What say we head out there right now?

381
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,104
Your associates are welcome.

382
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:40,124
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

383
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,738
I promise you,

384
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,463
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.

385
00:29:44,926 --> 00:29:45,926
And there...

386
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,729
I can explain your very,

387
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,850
special heritage.

388
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,338
Finally get to be,

389
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,771
the father I've always wanted to be.

390
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,598
Excuse me.

391
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,411
I've gotta take a whiz.

392
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,889
I'm not buying it.

393
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,204
Let's go take a walk.

394
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,410
I am Mantis.

395
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,678
What are you doing?

396
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,145
Smiling.

397
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,871
I hear it is the thing
to do to make people like you.

398
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,527
Not if you do it like that.

399
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,158
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

400
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,302
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.

401
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:47,488
Can I pet your puppy?

402
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,371
It is adorable.

403
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Yes.

404
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,558
That is called a practical joke!

405
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,998
I liked it very much!

406
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,198
I just made it up!

407
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:18,457
Give me a break!

408
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,258
After all this time, you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden you wanna be my dad?

409
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:22,998
I hear you.

410
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,662
And by the way, this could be a trap.

411
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:26,169
Ok. The Kree purists,

412
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:28,147
the Ravagers they all want us dead.

413
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:29,818
I know, but...
But what?

414
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,499
What was that story you told
me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

415
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Who?

416
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,211
He owned a magic boat?

417
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,327
David Hasselhoff?

418
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:38,996
Right.

419
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,358
Not a magic boat.

420
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,558
A talking car.

421
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,718
Why did he talk again?

422
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,098
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

423
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,158
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket

424
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,898
and you would tell all the other children

425
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,318
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

426
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,998
Shooting Knight Rider or
touring with his band in Germany.

427
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,518
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?

428
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,678
I love that story.

429
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,698
I hate that story.

430
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,325
It's so sad!

431
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,278
As a kid, I used to see all the other
kids off playing catch with their dad.

432
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,809
I wanted that,

433
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:11,589
more than anything in the world!

434
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,604
That's my point, Peter.

435
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,584
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

436
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,105
Listen.

437
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,928
If he ends up being evil,

438
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,110
we will just kill him.

439
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,198
You're leaving me with that fox?

440
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,518
He's not a fox.

441
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,738
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.

442
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,308
Or if you feel like it.
Okay.

443
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,220
It'll be just a couple of days.

444
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:47,798
We'll be back before Rocket's
finished fixing the ship.

445
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,301
What if the Sovereign come?

446
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,238
There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.

447
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,798
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

448
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,358
God, you're like an old woman.

449
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,044
Because I'm wise?

450
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,039
Why do you have so much luggage?

451
00:33:04,342 --> 00:33:06,104
I don't want Groot playing with my things.

452
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,626
I hope Daddy isn't as big
of a dick as you, orphan boy.

453
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:16,054
What is your goal here?

454
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:18,396
To get everybody to hate you?

455
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,292
Because it's working.

456
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,260
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

457
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,918
No one has ever asked
me a personal question.

458
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,671
Your antennae, what are they for?

459
00:34:16,774 --> 00:34:18,318
Their purpose?

460
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,318
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

461
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,184
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

462
00:34:23,587 --> 00:34:24,638
I say...

463
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,898
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low,

464
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,158
your antennae will feel this and
keep you from being decapitated.

465
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,060
Right.

466
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:35,294
And if it's anything other than you specifically
not being decapitated by a doorway,

467
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:36,294
I win.

468
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,778
They are not for feeling doorways.

469
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,500
I think,

470
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,878
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

471
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,178
What are those?

472
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:47,959
If I touch someone,

473
00:34:48,584 --> 00:34:50,285
I can feel their feelings.

474
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,438
You read minds?
No.

475
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,798
Telepaths know thoughts.

476
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,126
Empaths feel feelings.

477
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,881
Emotions.

478
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,486
May I?

479
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,745
All right.

480
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,761
You feel love.

481
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,613
Yeah. I guess yeah,

482
00:35:19,614 --> 00:35:21,558
I feel a general unselfish
love for just about everybody.

483
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,678
No!

484
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,998
Romantic, sexual love.

485
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,418
No, I don't.

486
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,790
For her!
No!

487
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:29,477
That is not...

488
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,196
Okay.

489
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,038
She just told everyone your
deepest, darkest secret!

490
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,518
Dude, come on.
I think you're overreacting a little bit!

491
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,038
You must be so embarrassed!

492
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:47,069
Do me! Do me! Do me!

493
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,958
I have never felt such humor!

494
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,402
So unbelievably uncool.

495
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,205
Oh, Quill.

496
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,531
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

497
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,978
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

498
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,457
Yeah, like what?

499
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,755
If I touch someone who is sad,

500
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:27,658
I can ease them into
contentment for a short while.

501
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,118
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

502
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,758
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.

503
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,749
He lies awake at night,

504
00:36:37,374 --> 00:36:39,454
thinking about his progeny.

505
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,221
Do one of those on me.

506
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,284
Sleep.

507
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,838
I love this song.

508
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,766
There!

509
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,808
Ain't so tough now without
all your toys, are you?

510
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Move!

511
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,866
Crap.

512
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,058
Hey there, rat!

513
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,298
How's it going, you blue idiot?

514
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,698
Not so bad.

515
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,758
We got ourselves a pretty
good little gig here.

516
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,109
This golden gal with quite a
high opinion of herself has

517
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,427
offered us a large sum,

518
00:40:22,428 --> 00:40:25,598
to deliver you and your pals over
to her because she wants to kill y'all.

519
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,698
Your friend.

520
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,538
There's too many of them.

521
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,284
He needs my help.

522
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:33,338
If you care about him,

523
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,038
you need to get me out of these bonds.

524
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,318
They are going to kill him!

525
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,798
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.

526
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,498
I put a tracer on your ship back there
during the war over Xandar.

527
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,758
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot,

528
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,249
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

529
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,558
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

530
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,358
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

531
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,557
Otherwise, you'd what?

532
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,598
We'll take them batteries.

533
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,943
They're worth what?

534
00:41:01,268 --> 00:41:02,998
A quarter mill on the open market?

535
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,418
That Priestess offered us a million.

536
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,498
A quarter is only one third of that!

537
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,878
A quarter ain't a third.

538
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,838
A quarter is 25.

539
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,640
No.

540
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:15,639
We can't even buy a pair
of boots with 25 units.

541
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,638
Enough!

542
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,878
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to
help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

543
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,360
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.

544
00:41:24,563 --> 00:41:25,841
That ain't right!

545
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:29,737
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.

546
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,918
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you

547
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,858
you protect him like none of
the rest of us much matter!

548
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,118
Yeah!

549
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,798
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

550
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,918
Take it easy, Kraglin.

551
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,174
Damn straight, lad.

552
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,598
He's gone soft.

553
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,448
Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.

554
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,158
Put your damn guns down!

555
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,938
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

556
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,618
Or even a violent one where
I'm standing over there.

557
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,764
Well, hello, boys.

558
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,810
It's not ripe.

559
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,466
Welcome everyone,

560
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:17,258
to my world.

561
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,620
You have your own planet?
Come on.

562
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:23,319
No larger than your Earth's Moon.

563
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,298
Humility.

564
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,758
I like it.

565
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,727
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

566
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,958
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

567
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,769
What are you exactly?

568
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,163
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

569
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,006
A Celestial, like a god?

570
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,878
Small g, son.

571
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,798
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.

572
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,638
I don't know where I came from exactly.

573
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:54,237
First thing I remember is flickering

574
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,406
adrift in the cosmos utterly

575
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,526
and entirely alone.

576
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,758
Over millions of years

577
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,638
I learned to control
the molecules around me.

578
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,723
I grew smarter and stronger.

579
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,877
And I continued building from there

580
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,158
layer by layer

581
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,918
the very planet you walk on now.

582
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,261
But I wanted more.

583
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,518
I desired,

584
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,381
meaning.

585
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,398
There must be some life
out there in the universe,

586
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,558
besides just me, I thought.

587
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,718
So, I set myself the task of finding it.

588
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,718
I created

589
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,218
what I imagined biological life to be like

590
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,286
down to the most minute detail.

591
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,918
Did you make a penis?

592
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,278
Dude!

593
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,678
What is wrong with you?

594
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,838
If he is a planet, how could
he make a baby with your mother?

595
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,477
He would smush her!

596
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,087
I don't need to hear how my parents.

597
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,521
Why?

598
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,038
My father would tell the story of
impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

599
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,638
That's disgusting.

600
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,085
It was beautiful.

601
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,970
You Earthers have hang-ups.

602
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,002
Yes Drax,

603
00:46:17,827 --> 00:46:18,918
I got a penis.

604
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,720
Thank you!

605
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,978
It's not half bad.

606
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,698
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system

607
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,438
and all the accompanying junk.

608
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,511
I wanted to experience,

609
00:46:31,636 --> 00:46:34,138
what it truly meant to be human,

610
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,944
as I set out amongst the stars,

611
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,778
until I found,

612
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,564
what I sought.

613
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,560
Life.

614
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,761
I was not alone in the universe after all.

615
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,303
When did you meet my mother?

616
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,144
Not long after.

617
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,688
It was with Meredith that
I first experienced love.

618
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:16,412
I...

619
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,063
called her my river lily.

620
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,526
And from that love Peter,

621
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,366
you.

622
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,867
I have searched for you for so long.

623
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,598
And when I heard of a man from Earth,

624
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,966
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying,

625
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:54,942
I knew you must be the son 
of the woman I loved.

626
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,881
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

627
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,049
This is mutiny!

628
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,058
This is mutiny!

629
00:48:25,582 --> 00:48:27,182
This is mutiny!

630
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,898
Captain!

631
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,758
Help me! Please!

632
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,585
Captain!

633
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,438
You're the one what killed those men,

634
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,549
by leading them down the wrong path.

635
00:49:30,094 --> 00:49:32,158
Because you're weak.

636
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,865
And stupid!

637
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,510
It's time for the Ravagers

638
00:49:40,713 --> 00:49:43,063
to rise once again to glory,

639
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,523
with a new captain,

640
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,038
Taserface!

641
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,811
I'm sorry.

642
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:57,758
Your name is...

643
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,078
It's Taserface?

644
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,297
That's right.

645
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,087
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

646
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,718
It's metaphorical!

647
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,562
Yeah!

648
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:12,162
For what?

649
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,358
For it is a name what strikes fear

650
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,278
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

651
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,840
Okay.

652
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,878
Okay.

653
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,558
Whatever you say.

654
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,038
You shut up.

655
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,458
You're next.

656
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,070
Udonta,

657
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,999
I have waited a long time to do...

658
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,520
What?

659
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,238
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

660
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,438
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir

661
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,598
looking in the mirror and then in
all seriousness saying to yourself

662
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,238
You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?

663
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,484
Taserface!

664
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:54,992
That's how I hear you in my head!

665
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,438
What was your second choice?

666
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,883
Scrotum Hat?

667
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,111
New plan. We're killing you first.

668
00:51:05,214 --> 00:51:09,838
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life

669
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,998
as a moronic shitbag who
thinks Taserface is a cool name.

670
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,744
That's enough killing for today.

671
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:22,263
She's the daughter of Thanos.

672
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,342
I thought you were the
biggest sadist in the galaxy.

673
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:29,438
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.

674
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,659
The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.

675
00:51:33,262 --> 00:51:36,884
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

676
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,698
I assure you.

677
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,998
I am not as easy a mark as an
old man without his magic stick

678
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,843
or a talking woodland beast.

679
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,083
I want 10% of the take,

680
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,529
and a couple more things.

681
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,058
We got a whole box of hands

682
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,409
if that one don't work out.

683
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:57,158
It is fine.

684
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,818
You... think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?

685
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,579
The Kree consider themselves merciful.

686
00:52:02,904 --> 00:52:04,318
It will be painless.

687
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,694
Well, here it is.

688
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:08,558
It's the best ship we got.

689
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,358
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

690
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,838
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

691
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,868
What are you gonna do with your share?

692
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,278
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

693
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,889
battle one another in training.

694
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,858
Every time my sister prevailed

695
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,038
my father would replace a
piece of me with machinery,

696
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,525
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

697
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,898
But she won,

698
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,545
again and again,

699
00:52:34,546 --> 00:52:37,571
and again, never once refraining.

700
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,858
So after I murder my sister.

701
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,898
I will buy a warship,

702
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,958
with every conceivable instrument of death.

703
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,458
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly,

704
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,358
piece by piece,

705
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,177
until he knows some semblance,

706
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:54,118
of the profound and unceasing pain.

707
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,949
I know every single day.

708
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,958
Yeah.

709
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,560
I was talking about like, a pretty necklace.

710
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,598
Or a nice hat.

711
00:53:04,622 --> 00:53:05,399
You know.

712
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,937
Something to make the other girls go...

713
00:53:07,262 --> 00:53:08,355
that's nice!

714
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,247
Anyways,

715
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:15,113
happy trails.

716
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,127
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

717
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,713
She had brain cancer, so everyone
thought she was delusional.

718
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:31,814
Peter.

719
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:35,338
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would, but you left,

720
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,238
the most wonderful woman ever,

721
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,318
to die alone.

722
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,578
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

723
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,238
If I don't return regularly to my planet

724
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,858
and the light within it

725
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,678
this form will wither and perish.

726
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,638
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

727
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,998
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?

728
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,118
I loved your mother, Peter!

729
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,538
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth,

730
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,144
where she wasn't living!

731
00:54:00,245 --> 00:54:01,638
You can't imagine what that's like!

732
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,698
I know exactly what that feels like!

733
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,864
I had to watch her die!

734
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,684
Over the millions,

735
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:16,820
and millions of years of my existence
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

736
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,867
But you're not one of them.

737
00:54:21,906 --> 00:54:25,527
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

738
00:54:30,575 --> 00:54:31,889
There's so much,

739
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:35,277
that I need to teach you about this planet,

740
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,798
and the light within.

741
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,429
They are a part of you, Peter.

742
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,544
What do you mean?

743
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,263
Give me your hands, son.

744
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,386
Here.

745
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,249
Hold them like that.

746
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,750
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.

747
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,898
Take your brain to the center of this planet.

748
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,959
Yes!

749
00:55:10,584 --> 00:55:11,482
Yes!

750
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:12,906
It's... Yes.

751
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:13,669
Yes!
It was...

752
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:14,758
It's okay.

753
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,038
Just relax. Concentrate.

754
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,878
You can do it. Bring it back.

755
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,761
Yes!

756
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:22,636
Yes. Yes now...

757
00:55:23,261 --> 00:55:24,458
shape it.

758
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,144
Feel that energy.

759
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,401
Yes.

760
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,951
You're home.

761
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,661
Peter.

762
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,170
How did you get to this weird,
dumb planet?

763
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,454
Ego found me in my larva state.

764
00:56:21,457 --> 00:56:23,385
Orphaned on my homeworld.

765
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,561
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.

766
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,791
So you're a pet?

767
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,291
I suppose.

768
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,818
People usually want cute pets.

769
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,458
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

770
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,238
I am hideous?

771
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,825
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

772
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,838
But that's a good thing.

773
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,958
When you're ugly, and someone loves you

774
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,786
you know they love you for who you are.

775
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,207
Beautiful people never know who to trust.

776
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,504
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.

777
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,896
Those pools,

778
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,038
they remind me of a time,

779
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,342
when I took my daughter,

780
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:08,191
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

781
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,018
She was like you.

782
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,765
Disgusting?

783
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,001
Innocent.

784
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,495
Drax?

785
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:52,524
There's something I must tell you.

786
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:02,027
What's going on?

787
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,278
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

788
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,278
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

789
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,758
You're not ugly. Drax!

790
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,438
What are you talking about?

791
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,675
Mantis,

792
00:58:12,678 --> 00:58:14,318
can you show us where we'll be staying?

793
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,438
Why are there no other
beings on this planet?

794
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,718
The planet is Ego.

795
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,717
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.

796
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,218
And you're not a flea?

797
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,141
I'm a flea with a purpose.

798
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,650
I help him sleep.

799
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,963
What were you about to say
to Drax before I walked out?

800
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,087
Nothing.

801
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,829
Your quarters are this way.

802
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,302
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.

803
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,349
Neither one of you will
last much longer after that.

804
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,168
Okay, Taserface.

805
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,158
Hey, tell the other guys we said,

806
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,571
Hi, Taserface!

807
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,438
Hey what about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

808
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,118
No, Gef.

809
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,758
It's too adorable to kill.

810
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,703
Take it to the tailor.

811
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,543
No offense, but your
employees are a bunch of jerks.

812
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,842
I was a Kree battle slave for
20 years when Stakar freed me.

813
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,978
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

814
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,178
He said all I needed
to do was adhere to the code.

815
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,489
But I was young,

816
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,987
and greedy, and stupid.

817
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,318
Like you stealing those batteries.

818
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,845
That was mostly Drax.

819
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,341
Me and Stakar and the other captains,

820
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,121
we weren't so different
from you and your friends.

821
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,003
The only family I ever had.

822
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,024
When I broke the code,

823
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,944
they exiled me.

824
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,998
This is what I deserve.

825
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,878
Slow down, drama queen.

826
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,678
You might deserve this, but I don't.

827
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,144
We gotta get outta here.

828
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,198
Where's Quill?

829
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,570
He went off with his old man.

830
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,258
Ego?
Yeah.

831
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,418
It's a day for dumb-ass names.

832
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,525
You're smiling.

833
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:33,998
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

834
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,838
But then it was ruined by
those disgusting-ass teeth.

835
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,291
You like a professional asshole or what?

836
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:40,558
Pretty much a pro.

837
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,145
Why didn't you deliver Quill
to Ego like you promised?

838
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,458
He was skinny.

839
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,090
Could fit into places we couldn't.

840
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,351
Good for thieving.

841
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,849
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

842
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,226
But we're gonna need your little friend.

843
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,247
Mascot, mascot, mascot,

844
01:01:16,112 --> 01:01:18,687
Little fellow's all worked up!
He needs a drink!

845
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,638
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.

846
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,118
He's goddang precious!

847
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,898
Hey, twig!

848
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,878
Come here.

849
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,720
Come on.

850
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,478
Oh man.

851
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,125
What did they do to you?

852
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,186
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?

853
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,277
There's something I need you
to get, and bring back to me.

854
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,918
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin,

855
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,968
the thing I wore on my head.

856
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:16,345
There's a drawer next to the bunk.

857
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:18,378
It's in that. It's red.

858
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,666
You got it?

859
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,158
That's my underwears.

860
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,398
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't
know what you were talkin' about.

861
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,402
You have to explain it more careful.

862
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,362
It's a prototype fin.

863
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,218
That's an orloni.

864
01:03:11,443 --> 01:03:12,758
It's a fin, Groot.

865
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,364
You explain it this time.

866
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,651
All right.

867
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,918
That's Vorker's eye.

868
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,978
He takes it out when he sleeps.

869
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,598
Go. Look again.

870
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,958
But leave the eye here.

871
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,538
Why?

872
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,198
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

873
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,218
and he's not gonna know

874
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,961
where his eye is!

875
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,718
That's a desk.

876
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,205
We told you it was this big.

877
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,918
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere,

878
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,798
with a bunch of severed human toes.

879
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,107
Okay. Then let's just
agree to never discuss this.

880
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,418
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.

881
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,920
Ok?

882
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,053
What? No!

883
01:04:17,256 --> 01:04:18,718
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.

884
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,198
That's not what I said!

885
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,124
I am Groot.

886
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:22,478
He's relieved you don't want him to.

887
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,118
I am Groot.
He hates hats.

888
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:24,998
I am Groot.

889
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,318
On anyone, not just himself.

890
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,238
I am Groot.

891
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,842
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head

892
01:04:28,844 --> 01:04:31,851
the next minute it's just because you
realize part of that head is the hat.

893
01:04:32,254 --> 01:04:33,630
That's why you don't like hats?

894
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:36,693
This is an important conversation right now?

895
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,066
That ain't it.

896
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,345
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

897
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,823
They killed all my friends.

898
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,486
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

899
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,566
One more thing.

900
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,361
You got any clones
of Quill's old music on the ship?

901
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,320
He's got it!

902
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,998
<i>Yondu's got the fin!</i>

903
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,922
<i>Go!</i>

904
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,790
Down there!

905
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,180
You maniac.

906
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,767
The whole ship's gonna blow.

907
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,478
Not the whole ship.

908
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:00,274
Who is this?

909
01:10:00,277 --> 01:10:04,478
I am sending you
the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

910
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,238
Release the quadrant!
Aye, Captain!

911
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,938
I only ask one thing.

912
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,038
That your High Priestess

913
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,723
tell him the name of the man
what sealed his fate.

914
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,429
Taserface!

915
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,478
Where to, Captain?

916
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,481
Ego.

917
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,167
No, boy!

918
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,758
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

919
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,878
I know that.

920
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,247
We are about to do 700!

921
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,248
So I guess this could all be mine someday.

922
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,532
Rocket?

923
01:11:22,057 --> 01:11:23,451
Rocket, are you there?

924
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,789
What are you doing, Peter?

925
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,718
Dance with me.

926
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,558
I'm not going to dance with you.

927
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,238
This is Sam Cooke,

928
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,503
one of the greatest Earth
singers of all time.

929
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,162
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

930
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,998
If you ever tell anyone about this

931
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,411
I will kill you.

932
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,751
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

933
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,191
What unspoken thing?

934
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,598
This...

935
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,058
Cheers, Sam and Diane,

936
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,573
a guy and a girl on a TV show,

937
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:35,989
who dig each other but never say it

938
01:12:36,014 --> 01:12:37,798
because if they do
the ratings would go down

939
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,938
sort of thing.

940
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,485
There's no unspoken thing.

941
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,518
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,

942
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,778
then it would be spoken

943
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,298
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it,

944
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,786
you are telling the truth,

945
01:12:50,811 --> 01:12:52,578
and admitting that there is.

946
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,803
No, that's not what I...

947
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,258
What we should be discussing right
now is something about this place.

948
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,798
It doesn't feel right.

949
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,518
What are you talking about?

950
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,058
You're the one who
wanted me to come here!

951
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,378
That girl Mantis she's afraid of something.

952
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,758
Why are you trying
to take this away from me?

953
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,138
I'm not trying.

954
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,058
He's my father. He's blood.

955
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,958
You have blood on Earth and you
never wanted to return there.

956
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,726
Again, you made me come here!

957
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,318
And Earth is the place where
my mother died in front of me.

958
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,198
No, it's because that place
is real, and this is a fantasy.

959
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,038
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?

960
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,400
That's the half I'm worried about.

961
01:13:29,403 --> 01:13:30,918
Oh, I get it.

962
01:13:30,919 --> 01:13:33,087
You're jealous because I'm part-god,

963
01:13:33,088 --> 01:13:34,359
and you like when I'm the weak one.

964
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,938
You were insufferable to begin with.

965
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,559
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

966
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,133
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

967
01:13:40,135 --> 01:13:42,798
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!

968
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,998
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing

969
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,798
to open themselves up to new possibility,

970
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,638
and the other person is a jerk.

971
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,518
Who doesn't trust anybody!

972
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,438
It's a show that doesn't exist.

973
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,358
That's why it would get zero ratings!

974
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,678
I don't know what Cheers is!

975
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,650
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

976
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,530
I thought you already had.

977
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,280
Damn it.

978
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,441
Psychopath!

979
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,264
Are you kidding me?

980
01:17:47,406 --> 01:17:48,597
I win.

981
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,958
I win. I bested you in combat.

982
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,038
No. I saved your life.

983
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,038
Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.

984
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,240
You let me live!

985
01:17:56,264 --> 01:17:58,119
I don't need you always trying to beat me!

986
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,918
I'm not the one that just flew across
the universe just because I wanted to win.

987
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,638
Do not tell me what I want.

988
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,238
I don't need to tell you what you want!

989
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,240
It's obvious!

990
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,671
You were the one who wanted to win.

991
01:18:06,695 --> 01:18:08,294
And I just wanted a sister!

992
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,765
You were all I had.

993
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,305
But you were the one
who needed to win.

994
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,227
Thanos pulled my eye from my head,

995
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,022
and my brain from my skull,

996
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,069
and my arm from my body,

997
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,528
because of you.

998
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,966
You all right, son?

999
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:00,317
I.

1000
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,597
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

1001
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,600
Yeah.

1002
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,098
It's fortuitous you listening to this song.

1003
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,521
You know...

1004
01:19:09,546 --> 01:19:10,438
Brandy?

1005
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:11,487
By Looking Glass?

1006
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,000
A favorite of your mom's.

1007
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,201
Yes, yeah it was.

1008
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:19,738
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

1009
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,693
Perhaps its very greatest.

1010
01:19:21,896 --> 01:19:22,954
Yeah. Yes.

1011
01:19:23,057 --> 01:19:24,310
You know, Peter, you and I we're...

1012
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,393
we're the sailor in that song.

1013
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,978
He came on a summer's day.

1014
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,960
Bringing gifts from far away.

1015
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:37,232
Like the child I put in your mother,

1016
01:19:37,435 --> 01:19:39,603
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

1017
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,958
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

1018
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,511
What a good wife you would be.

1019
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,418
My life, my love.

1020
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,358
My lady is the sea.

1021
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,958
The sea calls the sailor back.

1022
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,993
He loves the girl,

1023
01:19:58,018 --> 01:19:59,710
but that's not his place.

1024
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,705
The sea calls upon him as
history calls upon great men.

1025
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,927
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

1026
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,838
Well, you may not be mortal, but me.

1027
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,158
No, Peter.

1028
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,458
Death will remain a stranger to both of us,

1029
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,742
as long as the light burns within the planet.

1030
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,238
I'm immortal?

1031
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,138
Really?

1032
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,884
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1033
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,478
And I can use the light
to build cool things like...

1034
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,553
how you made this whole planet?

1035
01:20:32,656 --> 01:20:35,140
It might take you a few
million years of practice

1036
01:20:35,243 --> 01:20:37,718
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!

1037
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,198
What! This is...

1038
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:44,038
Get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man
with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

1039
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,398
You can do anything you want.

1040
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,838
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1041
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:50,058
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.

1042
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:52,738
Only we can remake the universe.

1043
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,478
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos

1044
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,924
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1045
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,480
How?

1046
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,165
Come with me.

1047
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,398
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1048
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,170
Drax! We need to talk.

1049
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,418
I'm sorry.

1050
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,478
But I like a woman with
some meat on her bones.

1051
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:33,718
What?

1052
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,158
I tried to let you down easily by
telling you I found you disgusting.

1053
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,978
No, that's not what I...

1054
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,382
What are you doing?

1055
01:21:43,785 --> 01:21:46,638
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1056
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,056
Drax. That's not.

1057
01:21:48,057 --> 01:21:49,838
I don't like you like that.

1058
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,218
I don't even like the type of thing you are.

1059
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,642
Hey! There's no need to get personal.

1060
01:21:54,845 --> 01:21:57,678
Listen!
Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1061
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,196
I should have told you earlier.

1062
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,436
I'm stupid.

1063
01:22:01,161 --> 01:22:02,742
You are in danger.

1064
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,361
What is that?

1065
01:22:12,467 --> 01:22:16,638
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

1066
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,440
Everything around us,

1067
01:22:19,265 --> 01:22:20,265
including the girl.

1068
01:22:20,289 --> 01:22:23,218
Everything is temporary.

1069
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,298
We are forever.

1070
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,118
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1071
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,223
Not if you have a purpose Peter,

1072
01:22:30,526 --> 01:22:32,438
which is why you're here.

1073
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,118
I told you how all those years ago

1074
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,298
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1075
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,350
But what I did not tell you was
how, when I finally did find it.

1076
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,706
It was all so...

1077
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,238
disappointing.

1078
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:53,118
And that is when I came,

1079
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,606
to a profound realization.

1080
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,978
My innate desire to seek out other life,

1081
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:07,644
was not so that I could walk among that life.

1082
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:11,041
Peter.

1083
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,289
I have found meaning.

1084
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,325
I see it.

1085
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,158
Eternity!

1086
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,650
Oh, my God.

1087
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:54,957
We need to get off this planet.

1088
01:24:09,139 --> 01:24:10,139
Oh, man.

1089
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,858
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted.

1090
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,850
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.

1091
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,078
What the hell you doing, boy?

1092
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,318
I could tell by how you talked about him

1093
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,798
this Ego is bad news.

1094
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,598
We're here to save Quill.

1095
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,600
For what?

1096
01:24:36,808 --> 01:24:38,093
For honor?

1097
01:24:38,318 --> 01:24:39,478
For love?
No.

1098
01:24:39,502 --> 01:24:41,494
I don't care about those things.

1099
01:24:41,518 --> 01:24:44,558
I wanna save Quill so I can
prove I'm better than him!

1100
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:47,378
I can lord this over him forever.

1101
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,857
What are you laughing at me for?

1102
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,085
You can fool yourself and everyone else,

1103
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:56,138
but you can't fool me.

1104
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,678
I know who you are.

1105
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:00,198
You don't know anything about me, loser.

1106
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,438
I know everything about you.

1107
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,398
I know you play like you're
the meanest and the hardest

1108
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,167
but actually you're the most scared of all.

1109
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:07,958
Shut up!

1110
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,378
I know you steal batteries you don't need,

1111
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,901
and you push away anyone who's
willing to put up with you

1112
01:25:12,904 --> 01:25:14,678
because just a little bit of love

1113
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:18,358
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1114
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,550
I said shut up!

1115
01:25:19,553 --> 01:25:23,318
I know them scientists what made
you, never gave a rat's ass about you.

1116
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,598
I'm serious, dude!

1117
01:25:24,622 --> 01:25:27,518
Just like my own damn
parents who sold me

1118
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:30,037
their own little baby into slavery.

1119
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,579
I know who you are, boy.

1120
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,282
Because you're me.

1121
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,082
What kind of a pair are we?

1122
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,398
The kind that's about
to go fight a planet, I reckon.

1123
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,556
All right, okay!

1124
01:25:49,681 --> 01:25:50,998
Good. Wait. Wait.

1125
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,486
Fight a what?

1126
01:25:56,746 --> 01:25:58,118
Who are you people?

1127
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,238
What is this place?

1128
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,398
Gamora, let her go!

1129
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,598
The bodies in the caverns.
Who are they?

1130
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,921
You are scared.

1131
01:26:08,072 --> 01:26:11,162
I call it the Expansion.

1132
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,044
It is my purpose,

1133
01:26:14,447 --> 01:26:19,347
now it is yours as well.

1134
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,765
It's beautiful.

1135
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,438
Over thousands of years,

1136
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,858
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself,

1137
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,238
on thousands of worlds.

1138
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,598
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose.

1139
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,638
To grow and spread,

1140
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,958
covering all that exists,

1141
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:45,110
until everything is...

1142
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,401
Me.

1143
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,838
What did she do to me?

1144
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,398
She already told me everything.

1145
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,071
I only had one problem.

1146
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:00,078
A single Celestial doesn't have
enough power for such an enterprise.

1147
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:03,158
But two Celestials.

1148
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,291
Well now,

1149
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:06,606
that just might do.

1150
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,605
The bodies,

1151
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,097
are his children.

1152
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,018
Out of all my labors,

1153
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:19,045
the most beguiling was attempting to graft

1154
01:27:19,046 --> 01:27:21,318
my DNA with that of another species.

1155
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,598
I hoped the result of such
a coupling would be enough

1156
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,443
to power the Expansion.

1157
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,298
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

1158
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,532
It broke the Ravager code but,

1159
01:27:32,733 --> 01:27:34,858
I compensated him generously

1160
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:37,778
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1161
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,438
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.

1162
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,178
But one after the other, they failed me.

1163
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,078
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.

1164
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,141
Until you, Peter.

1165
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,718
Out of all my spawn,

1166
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,358
only you carried the connection to the light.

1167
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,599
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.

1168
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,006
Ego will have won him to his side by now.

1169
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:04,199
He has a way.

1170
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,598
Then we just go.
No!

1171
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,896
He's our friend.

1172
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,359
All any of you do is yell at each other.

1173
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:10,518
You are not friends.

1174
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,698
You're right.

1175
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,639
We're family.

1176
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,885
We leave no one behind.

1177
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,638
Except maybe you.

1178
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,730
Oh, my God.

1179
01:28:23,933 --> 01:28:26,378
For the first time in my existence,

1180
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,504
I am truly not alone!

1181
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,321
What is it, son?

1182
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,841
My friends.

1183
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,200
You see,

1184
01:28:44,015 --> 01:28:46,359
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1185
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,039
Yes.

1186
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:51,078
We are beyond such things.

1187
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,081
Yes.

1188
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,040
Now...
But my mother.

1189
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,078
You said you loved my mother.

1190
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,605
And that I did.

1191
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,721
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1192
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,358
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

1193
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:15,738
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1194
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,510
I'd never leave.

1195
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,090
The Expansion,

1196
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,198
the reason for my very
existence, would be over.

1197
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,848
So, I did what I had to do.

1198
01:29:26,715 --> 01:29:27,715
But...

1199
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,342
it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1200
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,038
What?

1201
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,276
Now, all right.

1202
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:41,698
I know that sounds bad.

1203
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:57,038
In the hell do you think you are?

1204
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,758
You killed my mother!

1205
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,958
I tried

1206
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,778
so hard

1207
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,518
to find the form

1208
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,878
that best suited you,

1209
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,713
and this is the thanks I get?

1210
01:30:09,402 --> 01:30:12,213
You really need to grow up.

1211
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,738
I wanted to do this together

1212
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,178
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1213
01:30:21,202 --> 01:30:24,398
by spending the next
thousand years as a battery!

1214
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,358
Finally!

1215
01:30:27,782 --> 01:30:28,559
Rocket?

1216
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,865
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.

1217
01:30:30,868 --> 01:30:34,561
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used to slice

1218
01:30:34,585 --> 01:30:36,259
<i>open the Bank of A'askavaria.</i>

1219
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,299
Ego's unhinged.

1220
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,638
<i>I know. Get ready,</i>

1221
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:40,118
Drop her, Kraglin.

1222
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,520
No.

1223
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,239
My life,

1224
01:31:12,364 --> 01:31:13,838
My love.

1225
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,247
My lady is the sea.

1226
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,226
Peter,

1227
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,327
this is the sea.

1228
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,204
Hey, there, jackass!

1229
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,045
What is that thing?

1230
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,403
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1231
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,878
I told you something didn't feel right.

1232
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,558
I told you so.
Just what I need to hear right now.

1233
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,144
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1234
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,358
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1235
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,598
There is no unspoken thing.

1236
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,718
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!

1237
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:48,638
Thank you, Rocket?

1238
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,038
We had it under control.

1239
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,165
We did not.

1240
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:53,762
That is only an extension of his true self.

1241
01:32:53,763 --> 01:32:54,878
He will be back soon.

1242
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,219
What's Smurfette doing here?

1243
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,298
Whatever I need to do
to get a damn ride home.

1244
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,599
She tried to murder me!

1245
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,798
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1246
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,298
He's not a fox.

1247
01:33:03,322 --> 01:33:04,072
I am Groot.

1248
01:33:04,073 --> 01:33:05,438
I'm not a raboon, either.

1249
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,638
I am Groot.

1250
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,151
Raccoon. Whatever.

1251
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,038
How do we kill a Celestial?

1252
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,638
There's a center to him.

1253
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,838
His brain, his soul, whatever it is.

1254
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,678
Some sort of protective shell.

1255
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,781
It's in the caverns below the surface.

1256
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,485
Yondu?

1257
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,963
Thrusters are out.

1258
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:37,238
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.

1259
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,238
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me
to this maniac.

1260
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,838
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?

1261
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,958
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1262
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,198
Once I figured out what
happened to them other kids

1263
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,958
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1264
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,718
You said you were gonna eat me.

1265
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,131
That was being funny!

1266
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,318
Not to me!

1267
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,718
You people have issues.

1268
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,449
Of course I have issues.

1269
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,898
That's my freaking father!

1270
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,870
Thrusters are back up.

1271
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,918
We should be going up!
We can't!

1272
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,558
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.

1273
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,118
We have to kill him.

1274
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,958
Rocket!

1275
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:23,609
Got it!

1276
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,878
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1277
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,078
I guess.

1278
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,081
Awesome!

1279
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,558
We're really gonna be able
to jack up our prices

1280
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,358
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1281
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,118
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1282
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:54,038
It was just a random thought,
man. I thought we were friends.

1283
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,438
Of course, I care about the
planets, and the buildings

1284
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,358
and all the animals on the planets.

1285
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,718
And the people.

1286
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,094
Meh.

1287
01:35:01,097 --> 01:35:05,515
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

1288
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,398
<i>Pilots.</i>

1289
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,075
Release envoy units.

1290
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:51,790
<i>Our sensors detect the batteries
are below the surface of the planet.</i>

1291
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:54,960
Dive!

1292
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:13,680
Captain?

1293
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:14,960
<i>Captain?</i>

1294
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,718
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1295
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,918
He needs my genetic connection
to the light to help destroy the universe.

1296
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:29,138
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.

1297
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,418
So, could you?

1298
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,578
A little.

1299
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,178
I made a ball.

1300
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,438
A ball?

1301
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,438
I thought as hard as I could.

1302
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,058
It was all that I could come up with.

1303
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:39,178
You thought?

1304
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,618
You think when I make
this arrow fly I use my head?

1305
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:06,579
There.

1306
01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:08,248
That's Ego's core.

1307
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,398
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1308
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:14,050
I got it covered.

1309
01:37:20,261 --> 01:37:21,739
We must hurry.

1310
01:37:21,942 --> 01:37:24,248
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1311
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,566
Keep it steady.

1312
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,008
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1313
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,958
<i>Hey, Captain?</i>

1314
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,358
What is it, Kraglin?

1315
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,878
<i>Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?</i>

1316
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:50,978
Yeah, why?

1317
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,118
Oh, hell!

1318
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,918
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1319
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,798
They blew out the generator.

1320
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,176
I think I packed a small detonator.

1321
01:38:20,179 --> 01:38:22,478
A detonator is worthless without explosives.

1322
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,970
Well, we got these.

1323
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:26,869
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1324
01:38:26,872 --> 01:38:28,998
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction

1325
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,878
throughout his entire nervous system.

1326
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,838
Meaning what?

1327
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,518
The entire planet will explode.

1328
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,118
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1329
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,724
I rigged a timer.

1330
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,761
Go!

1331
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,689
He's coming.

1332
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,158
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

1333
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,918
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1334
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,158
I can't!

1335
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,649
You don't have to believe in yourself

1336
01:39:04,852 --> 01:39:07,298
because I believe in you.

1337
01:39:19,463 --> 01:39:20,658
Sleep!

1338
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,918
I never thought she'd be able to do it

1339
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:32,261
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.

1340
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,804
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1341
01:39:39,444 --> 01:39:40,822
The metal's too thick.

1342
01:39:40,825 --> 01:39:42,003
For the bomb to work,

1343
01:39:42,028 --> 01:39:44,638
we'd actually need to place it
on Ego's core.

1344
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:47,597
And our fat butts ain't gonna
fit through those tiny holes.

1345
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:48,901
Well...

1346
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,398
That's a terrible idea.

1347
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,687
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.

1348
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,318
Unbelievable.

1349
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,527
Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that.

1350
01:40:02,228 --> 01:40:03,510
What a day.

1351
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:14,651
All right, first you flick
this switch, then this switch.

1352
01:40:14,654 --> 01:40:16,178
That activates it.

1353
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:18,278
Then you push this button

1354
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,478
which will give you five
minutes to get out of there.

1355
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,023
Now, whatever you do

1356
01:40:23,326 --> 01:40:25,858
don't push this button

1357
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,718
because that will set off the bomb
immediately and we'll all be dead.

1358
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,118
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1359
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:33,978
I am Groot.

1360
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,398
I am Groot.
That's right.

1361
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,958
I am Groot.
No!

1362
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:40,438
No, that's the button that will kill everyone!

1363
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:41,922
Try again.

1364
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,678
I am Groot.

1365
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,818
I am Groot.

1366
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,798
I am Groot.

1367
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,798
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1368
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,558
How is that even possible?

1369
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,633
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1370
01:40:55,636 --> 01:40:56,698
Point to it.

1371
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:58,518
No!

1372
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,438
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1373
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:02,358
Shut up and get me some tape!

1374
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,878
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1375
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,798
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

1376
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,157
I don't have any tape.

1377
01:41:07,182 --> 01:41:08,338
Let me check.

1378
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:10,238
Yo, Yondu?

1379
01:41:10,262 --> 01:41:11,339
Do you ha...

1380
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,538
Do you have any tape?

1381
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:17,220
Gamora?

1382
01:41:17,345 --> 01:41:18,619
Do you have any tape?

1383
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,418
Tape!

1384
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:21,866
Never mind.

1385
01:41:23,879 --> 01:41:26,477
Drax, do you have any tape?

1386
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:29,138
Yes, Scotch tape would work.

1387
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,518
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,

1388
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,810
if you don't have any?

1389
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,438
Nobody has any tape!

1390
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,394
Not a single person has tape?

1391
01:41:37,697 --> 01:41:38,305
Nope!

1392
01:41:38,306 --> 01:41:39,686
Did you ask Nebula?

1393
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,238
Yes!

1394
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:42,678
Are you sure?

1395
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,220
I asked Yondu
and she was sitting next to him.

1396
01:41:45,245 --> 01:41:46,398
I knew you were lying!

1397
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,402
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1398
01:41:49,405 --> 01:41:51,238
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1399
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,958
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1400
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,340
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1401
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,723
We're all gonna die.

1402
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,798
Rear thrusters are out again!

1403
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:12,485
We're done for without that generator!

1404
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,080
<i>Guardians,</i>

1405
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,967
<i>perhaps it will provide you solace</i>

1406
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:32,478
<i>that your deaths are not without purpose.</i>

1407
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,598
<i>They will serve as a warning</i>

1408
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,418
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

1409
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,330
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1410
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,318
This is gonna hurt.

1411
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,845
Promises, promises.

1412
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,558
Hey!

1413
01:43:09,919 --> 01:43:10,919
No!

1414
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,648
No! No! No!

1415
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,233
We're gonna blow!

1416
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,700
Peter! No!

1417
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,558
What?

1418
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,718
You look like Mary Poppins.

1419
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,131
Is he cool?

1420
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,570
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1421
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,209
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1422
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:27,608
Mantis, look out!

1423
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,324
She's just unconscious.

1424
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,078
How long until the bomb goes off?

1425
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:01,598
In the unlikely event that
Groot doesn't kill us all

1426
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,761
about six minutes.

1427
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:10,478
Kraglin, we need the quadrant
for an extraction.

1428
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:11,638
<i>T-minus five minutes.</i>

1429
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:12,701
Aye, Captain.

1430
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:19,204
Somebody's gotta be up
top when Kraglin arrives.

1431
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,365
Drax, take Mantis.

1432
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,658
My nipples!

1433
01:45:33,707 --> 01:45:34,913
Gamora!

1434
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,038
Peter!

1435
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,459
Get over it.

1436
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:09,186
Come now, Peter.

1437
01:46:09,211 --> 01:46:11,525
I know this isn't what you want.

1438
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:18,378
What kind of father would I
be to let you make this choice?

1439
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,258
Yeah!

1440
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,601
Soon Peter, we will be all there is.

1441
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,163
So stop pissing me off!

1442
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,509
We have to get up to the extraction point!

1443
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,160
Go!

1444
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,318
I told you.

1445
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:32,732
I don't want to do this alone.

1446
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,008
You cannot deny

1447
01:49:38,011 --> 01:49:41,844
the purpose the universe
has bestowed upon you.

1448
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:52,958
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1449
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,961
What is that?

1450
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,927
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1451
01:50:13,688 --> 01:50:17,084
Why are you destroying our chance?

1452
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,969
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

1453
01:50:24,964 --> 01:50:25,965
One in billions.

1454
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,478
Trillions. Even more.

1455
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,605
What greater meaning can
life possibly have to offer?

1456
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,478
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

1457
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,369
I use my heart...

1458
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:24,478
You shouldn't have killed my
mom, and squished my Walkman.

1459
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,718
Groot? Groot If you can hear me, hurry up!

1460
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,038
I'm not sure how long Quill
can keep him distracted!

1461
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,710
Groot, hurry!

1462
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,998
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1463
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,418
Get to the ship!

1464
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:13,998
Not without Quill!

1465
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,889
You need to take care of the twig!

1466
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:18,769
Not without you!

1467
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,422
I ain't done nothing right
my whole damn life, rat.

1468
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,608
You need to give me this.

1469
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:41,797
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1470
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,782
I only have one of each.

1471
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,970
I am Groot.

1472
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,841
What's that?

1473
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:05,958
He says, welcome to the
frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy.

1474
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:08,647
Only he didn't use fricking.

1475
01:54:14,972 --> 01:54:16,041
Bye, twig.

1476
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:21,242
We're gonna need to have a real
discussion about your language.

1477
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,161
Where's Peter?

1478
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,568
Rocket, where is he?

1479
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:21,838
Rocket.

1480
01:55:21,940 --> 01:55:23,510
Rocket, look at me!
Where is he?

1481
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:30,482
No.

1482
01:55:30,907 --> 01:55:32,531
I'm not leaving without him.

1483
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:40,201
I'm sorry.

1484
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,658
I can only afford to lose one friend today.

1485
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:46,237
Kraglin, go!

1486
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:47,541
Wait.

1487
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,370
Is Quill back?

1488
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,426
Rocket, where's Quill?

1489
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,528
Rocket, where's Quill?

1490
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,320
<i>Rocket!</i>

1491
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:02,902
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

1492
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:05,858
<i>Where's Quill?</i>

1493
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,376
No, we need to stop it.

1494
01:56:16,379 --> 01:56:17,831
We need to stop it.

1495
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:23,040
Stop.

1496
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,638
Stop. Listen. Listen to me!

1497
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,365
You are a god.

1498
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,738
If you kill me,

1499
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,720
you'll be just like everybody else.

1500
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:35,638
What's so wrong with that?

1501
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,562
No!

1502
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,418
He may have been your father boy,

1503
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,165
but he wasn't your daddy.

1504
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,681
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1505
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:41,047
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1506
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:45,926
What?

1507
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,238
Yondu, what are you doing?

1508
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,366
You can't.

1509
01:58:02,038 --> 01:58:03,039
Yondu!

1510
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:09,605
No!

1511
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,522
No!

1512
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,880
No!

1513
01:58:20,288 --> 01:58:21,430
No!

1514
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,843
Oh, no!

1515
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,478
I told Gamora

1516
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,478
how when I was a kid I used to pretend

1517
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,389
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1518
01:59:26,518 --> 01:59:29,688
He's a singer and actor from
Earth, really famous guy.

1519
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,209
Earlier, it struck me.

1520
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:39,058
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.

1521
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:41,598
He didn't have the beautiful
voice of an angel

1522
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,658
but he did have the whistle of one.

1523
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,598
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures

1524
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,718
and hooked up with hot women,

1525
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,288
and fought robots.

1526
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,658
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind
of end up being my dad after all.

1527
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:00,858
Only it was you, Yondu.

1528
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:08,709
I had a pretty cool dad.

1529
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,851
What I'm trying to say here is,

1530
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,128
sometimes that thing you're
searching for your whole life,

1531
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,758
it's right there by your side all along.

1532
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,769
You don't even know it.

1533
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,325
I am Groot.

1534
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,384
He did call you twig.

1535
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:47,051
Nebula,

1536
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,168
I was a child like you.

1537
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:59,358
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.

1538
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:01,918
And I never considered what
Thanos was doing to you.

1539
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,138
I'm trying to make it right.

1540
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,998
There are little girls like you

1541
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,844
across the universe who are in danger.

1542
02:01:11,125 --> 02:01:13,010
You can stay with us and help them.

1543
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:16,158
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1544
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,208
I don't know if that's possible.

1545
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,148
You will always be my sister.

1546
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:20,807
Pete!

1547
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:26,158
Captain found this for you in a junker shop.

1548
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:28,704
Said you'd come back to the fold someday.

1549
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:31,978
What is it?

1550
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,078
It's called a Zune.

1551
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:35,481
It's what everybody's
listening to on Earth nowadays.

1552
02:02:35,484 --> 02:02:36,838
It's got 300 songs on it.

1553
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:39,127
300 songs?

1554
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:45,280
Wait.

1555
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:53,518
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.

1556
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,666
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1557
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:00,425
Thanks,

1558
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,600
Captain.

1559
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:17,211
They came.

1560
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:26,725
What is it?

1561
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,998
I sent word to Yondu's
old Ravager buddies,

1562
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,445
and told them what he did.

1563
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,929
It's a Ravager funeral.

1564
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,917
Yeah!

1565
02:04:56,003 --> 02:04:57,410
Yeah!

1566
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,603
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1567
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,364
No, he did not, son.

1568
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,805
He did not.

1569
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,803
Fare thee well, old friend.

1570
02:05:24,540 --> 02:05:25,957
Yondu Udonta,

1571
02:05:26,782 --> 02:05:28,652
I will see you in the stars.

1572
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,918
He didn't chase them away.

1573
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:36,146
No.

1574
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,078
Even though he yelled at them.

1575
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:41,460
And was always mean.

1576
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,768
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1577
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,970
Well, of course not.

1578
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:18,321
What?

1579
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,161
It's just...

1580
02:06:22,636 --> 02:06:24,477
some unspoken thing.

1581
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,488
It's beautiful.

1582
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,366
It is.

1583
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,008
And so are you.

1584
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,240
On the inside.

1585
02:07:10,464 --> 02:07:13,464

<font color="#ffff80"><i>Sync & corrections September 2017</i></font>

1586
02:08:41,797 --> 02:08:43,480
You know, it's a shame

1587
02:08:43,483 --> 02:08:48,018
that it took the tragedy of losing
Yondu to bring us all together again.

1588
02:08:48,227 --> 02:08:51,897
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we are back as a team.

1589
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,238
I'm in.

1590
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,238
Dope.

1591
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,478
I miss you guys so much!

1592
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,686
Hell, yes.

1593
02:09:00,635 --> 02:09:02,558
What say we steal some shit?

1594
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:23,062
High Priestess,

1595
02:11:23,087 --> 02:11:24,688
the Council is waiting.

1596
02:11:24,891 --> 02:11:27,963
They are perturbed I've
wasted our resources.

1597
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:35,880
When they see what I have
created here their wrath,

1598
02:11:35,905 --> 02:11:36,917
will dissipate.

1599
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:42,204
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1600
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:44,598
That my child,

1601
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,998
is the next step in our evolution.

1602
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:48,502
More powerful,

1603
02:11:48,627 --> 02:11:50,118
more beautiful,

1604
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:54,370
more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1605
02:11:56,914 --> 02:11:58,960
I think I shall call him,

1606
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:02,531
Adam.

1607
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:06,465
Dude.

1608
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:08,446
Seriously?

1609
02:14:08,549 --> 02:14:10,758
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

1610
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,558
I am Groot.

1611
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:14,591
I am not boring. You're boring.

1612
02:14:14,694 --> 02:14:15,838
You know what's boring?

1613
02:14:15,940 --> 02:14:18,858
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1614
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,778
What's boring is me tripping
over your vines every day!

1615
02:14:23,080 --> 02:14:24,478
I'm not boring!

1616
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:25,927
I am Groot.

1617
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:29,120
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1618
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:07,687
In these times of hardship

1619
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,548
just remember

1620
02:15:11,347 --> 02:15:15,397
We. Are. Groot.

1621
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,158
Hey, fellas.

1622
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,898
Hey wait, where are you going?

1623
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:24,418
Hey you were supposed
to be my lift home.

1624
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:26,358
How will I get out of here?

1625
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:27,758
Hey, ah gee,

1626
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,678
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1627
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:31,938
Guys.

1628
02:15:31,962 --> 02:15:33,962
Oh gee.
