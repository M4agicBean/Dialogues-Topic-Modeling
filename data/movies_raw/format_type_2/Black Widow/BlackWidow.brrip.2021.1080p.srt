00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,609
<b>Hey, Nat!</b>

2
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,682
<b>We're both upside down.</b>

3
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,934
<b>And I bet you're gonna fall down first.</b>

4
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,644
<b>No, you will.</b>

5
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,439
<b>You can't hold it much longer.</b>

6
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,860
<b>Told you you'd fall down first.</b>

7
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,322
<b>I told you! I told you!</b>

8
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,950
<b>Told you so!</b>

9
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,412
<b>Mommy!</b>

10
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,505
<b>What happened?</b>

11
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,424
<b>She fell on her knee.</b>

12
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,551
<b>- Oh, you bump your knee?
- Mmm-hmm.</b>

13
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,844
<b>Oh...</b>

14
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,807
<b>Kiss it better. There we go.</b>

15
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,936
<b>Oh, come on, little one.</b>

16
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,729
<b>Get up. You're okay.</b>

17
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,899
<b>Come on. You're a brave girl.</b>

18
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,610
<b>Your pain only makes you stronger.</b>

19
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,196
<b>- Right, you?
- Yeah.</b>

20
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,519
<b>- Yeah?
- Look!</b>

21
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,491
<b>Forest stars.</b>

22
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,778
<b>Yeah. You know what?</b>

23
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,579
<b>Those are actually
part of the Lampyridae family.</b>

24
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,291
<b>And the glow, the glow that you see,</b>

25
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,920
<b>that comes from
a chemical reaction called...</b>

26
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,631
<b>bioluminescence.</b>

27
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,716
<b>Come on, time for dinner.</b>

28
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,094
<b>Bio-goomin-feasants?</b>

29
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,638
<b>"Bio-goomin-feasants."
That's right.</b>

30
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,516
<b>Dinner!</b>

31
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,852
<b>Come on, dinner, big girl!</b>

32
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,897
<b>I want mac and cheese.</b>

33
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,693
<b>Oh, you want mac and cheese?
Okay. Well, I want...</b>

34
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,778
<b>caviar and champagne.</b>

35
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,780
<b>Grab the napkins.</b>

36
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,324
<b>You take this. Thank you.</b>

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,244
<b>Oh, would you grab
the ranch dressing for Dad?</b>

38
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,708
<b>Okay.</b>

39
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,698
<b>Green beans
are my favorite vegetable.</b>

40
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,671
<b>Dad's home!</b>

41
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,967
<b>Hey, Dad.</b>

42
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,552
<b>Hey, baby.</b>

43
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,647
<b>Everything okay?</b>

44
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,903
<b>How was everybody's day?</b>

45
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,071
<b>Mommy taught me
about lamp bugs.</b>

46
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,074
<b>- Lamp bugs.
- And I fell and hurt my knee,</b>

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,785
<b>- but it doesn't hurt anymore.
- Mmm-hmm.</b>

48
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,069
<b>And we also saw
fireflies in the backyard.</b>

49
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,122
<b>That was my favorite part</b>

50
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,248
<b>- of the whole day.
- No.</b>

51
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,780
<b>Yelena,
we see fireflies every year.</b>

52
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,793
<b>How long do we have?</b>

53
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,463
<b>I don't know. Like, an hour, maybe.</b>

54
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,009
<b>I don't wanna go.</b>

55
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,180
<b>Don't say that.</b>

56
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,393
<b>Girls...</b>

57
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,023
<b>you remember when I told you that
one day we would have that big adventure?</b>

58
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,903
<b>- Today's the day.
- Yay!</b>

59
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,866
<b>All right, let's go.</b>

60
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,625
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

61
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,830
<b>- Come on, we gotta hurry.
- Thank you.</b>

62
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,081
<b>- I don't have my shoes.
- Thank you, baby.</b>

63
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,803
<b>That's okay. You don't need your shoes.</b>

64
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,222
<b>- But I'm still hungry.
- Yeah? Guess what?</b>

65
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,765
<b>I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.</b>

66
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,777
<b>No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.</b>

67
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,619
<b>- You have it?
- Yeah.</b>

68
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,830
<b>- It's the only copy?
- It's the only one not on fire.</b>

69
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,301
<b>Where are we going?</b>

70
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,261
<b>Home.</b>

71
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,722
<b>Mommy, you're silly.</b>

72
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,473
<b>We just left home.</b>

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,653
<b>I want my song.</b>

74
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,117
<b>Bye, bye, Miss American Pie.</b>

75
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:12,289
<b>Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry.</b>

76
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,835
<b>Them good old boys
were drinking whiskey and rye.</b>

77
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:21,256
<b>Singing, "This'll be the day that I die".</b>

78
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,594
<b>"This'll be the day that I die."</b>

79
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,959
<b>Come on, Yelena.
Hurry up, baby.</b>

80
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,253
<b>Let's go. Come on, Nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.</b>

81
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,879
<b>We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.</b>

82
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,141
<b>Come on. Honey, honey.</b>

83
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,339
<b>- Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
- Okay.</b>

84
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,831
<b>- Nat, hurry up!
- I'm coming!</b>

85
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,064
<b>Okay. Seat belts.</b>

86
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:22,985
<b>Okay.</b>

87
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,140
<b>Why isn't Dad in the plane?</b>

88
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,872
<b>He's coming. He's coming, baby.
He's coming.</b>

89
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,530
<b>Mom?</b>

90
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,791
<b>Mom!</b>

91
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,795
<b>I need you up here.</b>

92
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,257
<b>- Okay.
- Okay.</b>

93
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,301
<b>I need you to pull right.</b>

94
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,057
<b>Mom, you've got blood on you.</b>

95
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,225
<b>It's okay, baby.</b>

96
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,954
<b>Hit the accelerator there.</b>

97
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,173
<b>Hold it steady, hold it steady.</b>

98
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,802
<b>You're gonna pull back at 55 knots.</b>

99
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,303
<b>Let's count together.</b>

100
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,931
<b>45, 50...</b>

101
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,737
<b>Pull back.
You can do it!</b>

102
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,948
<b>Pull back.
All your strength.</b>

103
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,870
<b>Okay.</b>

104
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,129
<b>Get up, Mommy.</b>

105
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,508
<b>Pain only makes you stronger, remember?</b>

106
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,727
<b>The Red Guardian returns.</b>

107
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,355
<b>The Red Guardian returns triumphant.</b>

108
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,567
<b>Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.</b>

109
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,778
<b>I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.</b>

110
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,946
<b>I wanna get back in it.</b>

111
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,490
<b>General Dreykov,
it's been over 3 years.</b>

112
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,984
<b>Never let them take your heart.</b>

113
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,625
<b>Did you get it?</b>

114
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,591
<b>And the North Institute?</b>

115
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,218
<b>Ashes.</b>

116
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,761
<b>It's gonna be okay.</b>

117
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,972
<b>How is Melina?</b>

118
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,432
<b>She'll live. She's strong.</b>

119
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,771
<b>- Mommy?
- Mom?</b>

120
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,898
<b>- Daddy!
- I'll handle this.</b>

121
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,692
<b>- Daddy! Daddy!
- Yelena!</b>

122
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,402
<b>- Daddy!
- Get away from her!</b>

123
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,238
<b>Don't touch her!</b>

124
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,284
<b>Don't touch her!</b>

125
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,953
<b>I will kill you all!</b>

126
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,624
<b>Honey.</b>

127
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,897
<b>You're gonna need to hand me that gun.</b>

128
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,051
<b>I don't wanna go back there.</b>

129
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,304
<b>I wanna stay in Ohio.</b>

130
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,056
<b>You can't take her.</b>

131
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,185
<b>You can't.</b>

132
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,978
<b>She's only 6.</b>

133
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,345
<b>You were even younger.</b>

134
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:12,024
<b>It's okay.</b>

135
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,943
<b>Come here.</b>

136
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,655
<b>You're gonna be all right.</b>

137
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,386
<b>Do you know why
it's gonna be all right?</b>

138
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,042
<b>'Cause my girls are
the toughest girls in the world.</b>

139
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,253
<b>You're gonna take care
of each other, okay?</b>

140
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,090
<b>And everything,
everything's gonna be fine.</b>

141
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,359
<b>That one, she has fire in her.</b>

142
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,029
<b>What was her name?</b>

143
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,448
<b>Natasha.</b>

144
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,412
<b>Ah... Natasha.</b>

145
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,147
<b>No!</b>

<b>Get off me! No!</b>

155
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,889
<b>Undercover spies in our communities.</b>

156
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,725
<b>They took on false identities,
even raised families...</b>

00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,472
<b>- They're topside, sir!
- Tier 1 has LOS!</b>

158

<b>We've got all exits covered.</b>

159
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,477
<b>All right. Stay alert.</b>

160
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,312
<b>I'm sending in alpha squad.</b>

<b>Natasha Romanoff is in violation

<b>She assaulted the King of Wakanda.</b>

163
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,160
<b>Make an example out of her.</b>

164
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,168
<b>- Yeah?
- Don't do this.</b>

165
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,545
<b>Do what?</b>

166
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,547
<b>Come after me.</b>

167
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,912
<b>I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.</b>

168
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,718
<b>Thought maybe you'd be
calling me to cut a deal.</b>

169
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,555
<b>'Cause from my vantage point,</b>

<b>What is this, your second triple bypass?</b>

174
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,731

00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,111
<b>the incredible shrinking convict.</b>

177
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,989
<b>Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.</b>

178
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:53,615
<b>Where you gonna go?</b>

179
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,118
<b>I've lived a lot of lives
before I met you, Ross.</b>

180
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,871
<b>You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. I'm done.</b>

181
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,540
<b>Romanoff?</b>

182
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,526
<b>Got an empty nest,
Secretary Ross.</b>

183
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,653
<b>Her tracker, sir.</b>

184
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,383
<b>Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.</b>

185
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,888
<b>I have sights on collateral one.</b>

186
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,352
<b>Firing in place of 3.</b>

187
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,145
<b>5, 4..</b>

188
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,233
<b>She made us.
Target deployed smoke.</b>

189
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,944
<b>She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.</b>

190
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,270
<b>Oksana.</b>

191
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:31,732
<b>Oh, no.</b>

192
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,692
<b>What did I do?</b>

193
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,652
<b>Free the others.</b>

194
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,247
<b>Yelena, we need a status report.</b>

195
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,629
<b>Yelena,
we need a status report.</b>

196
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,804
<b>Converge on team leader.</b>

197
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,062
<b>General Dreykov,
we have a deserter.</b>

198
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,649
<b>Permission to activate
Taskmaster Protocol?</b>

199
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,966
<b>Smile.</b>

200
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,666
<b>You're in my bed.</b>

201
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,793
<b>I'm... I'm not even under the covers.</b>

202
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,241
<b>Did you get everything on my list?</b>

203
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:03,467
<b>Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.</b>

204
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,054
<b>Mix and match, you should be able to
stretch it to 20 or so identities.</b>

205
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,847
<b>Fanny Longbottom?</b>

206
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,807
<b>- What?
- What, are you 12?</b>

207
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:14,561
<b>That is a legitimate name.</b>

208
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,022
<b>We've got a generator outside.</b>

209
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:20,305
<b>It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,</b>

210
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,117
<b>but, you know,
I've got a guy coming for that.</b>

211
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,072
<b>You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.</b>

212
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,283
<b>I've got your basic hardware kit
stashed under the stairs.</b>

213
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:29,952
<b>Nice.</b>

214
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,870
<b>Are you okay?</b>

215
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,163
<b>Why wouldn't I be?</b>

216
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,250
<b>I hear things. You know, something
about the Avengers getting divorced...</b>

217
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,544
<b>Ugh. It's fine.</b>

218
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,327
<b>I'm actually better on my own.</b>

219
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,421
<b>Are you sure?</b>

220
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,173
<b>Yeah.</b>

221
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,950
<b>Because you can tell me, you know.</b>

222
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,810
<b>That's the way
the whole friends thing works.</b>

223
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,721
<b>I know. I have friends.</b>

224
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,766
<b>People who have friends don't call me.</b>

225
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,899
<b>And I don't pay you to worry.</b>

226
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,332
<b>Oh, hey.</b>

227
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,626
<b>What's all this junk?</b>

228
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,880
<b>Oh, just some mail and personals
from the Budapest safe house.</b>

229
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:24,798
<b>Budapest?</b>

230
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,967
<b>Yeah. Budapest.</b>

231
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,303
<b>- No, it's "Budapest."
- Budapest.</b>

232
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,554
<b>Budapest.</b>

233
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,806
<b>- It's "Budapest."
- Whatever.</b>

234
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:36,185
<b>I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.</b>

235
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,800
<b>Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to chuck it.</b>

236
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,939
<b>Well, if you don't want it,
throw it in the rubbish.</b>

237
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,622
<b>You're not
a sportsman, Mr. Bond.</b>

238
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,415
<b>Why did you break up the encounter</b>

239
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,512
<b>with my pet python?</b>

240
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,139
<b>Because I discovered
he had a crush on me.</b>

241
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:18,673
<b>Moonraker 1
on preset launch program...</b>

242
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,770
<b>Oh, great.</b>

243
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,396
<b>...minus 2 minutes.</b>

244
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,981
<b>Retract crew access...</b>

245
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,792
<b>I'm pretty sure Ross
has no jurisdiction here.</b>

246
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,048
<b>And you should know I'm a better shot
when I'm pissed off.</b>

247
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:15,863
<b>You're not here for me.</b>

248
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,306
<b>Oh, shit.</b>

249
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,503
<b>I know you're out there.</b>

250
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,285
<b>I know you know I'm out here.</b>

251
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,586
<b>Then why are you skulking about
like it's a minefield?</b>

252
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,713
<b>'Cause I don't know
if I can trust you.</b>

253
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,799
<b>Funny,
I was going to say the same thing.</b>

254
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,013
<b>So, we gonna talk
like grown-ups?</b>

255
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,725
<b>Is that what we are?</b>

256
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,779
<b>Put it down before I make you.</b>

257
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,030
<b>You put yours down.</b>

258
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,367
<b>Watch your step.</b>

259
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,722
<b>Stay down. Stay down.</b>

260
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,308
<b>Stay down.</b>

261
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:10,908
<b>Stop.</b>

262
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:40,557
<b>You had to come
to Budapest, didn't you?</b>

263
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,482
<b>I came here
because I thought you wouldn't.</b>

264
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:47,361
<b>But since you're here,
what bullet does that?</b>

265
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,782
<b>Not bullets. Arrows.</b>

266
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,033
<b>Ah, right.</b>

267
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,370
<b>If you didn't think I'd come here,
why'd you send me this?</b>

268
00:33:56,995 --> 00:33:58,413
<b>You brought it back here?</b>

269
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,615
<b>I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.</b>

270
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,045
<b>It's a synthetic gas.</b>

271
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,589
<b>The counteragent to chemical subjugation.</b>

272
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,466
<b>The gas immunizes
the brain's neuropathways</b>

273
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,630
<b>from external manipulation.</b>

274
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,010
<b>Maybe in English next time?</b>

275
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,797
<b>Why don't you take it
to one of your super-scientist friends?</b>

276
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:19,935
<b>They can explain it to you.</b>

277
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,603
<b>Tony Stark, maybe?</b>

278
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,273
<b>Oh, yeah. We're not really
talking right now, so...</b>

279
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,400
<b>Great. Perfect timing.</b>

280
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,652
<b>Where's an Avenger when you need one?</b>

281
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:29,820
<b>I don't wanna be here.</b>

282
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,239
<b>I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.</b>

283
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,991
<b>Well, what was I supposed to do?</b>

284
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:37,077
<b>You're the only superhero person
that I know.</b>

285
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,039
<b>That was the whole reason
I sent it to you.</b>

286
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:45,586
<b>I kept checking the news,</b>

287
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:50,174
<b>expecting to see Captain America
bringing down the Red Room.</b>

288
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,345
<b>What?</b>

289
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,891
<b>Taking down the Red Room?
What are you talking about?</b>

290
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:00,642
<b>It's been gone for years.</b>

291
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:02,644
<b>Dreykov's dead.</b>

292
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,188
<b>I killed him.</b>

293
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,440
<b>You don't actually believe that, do you?</b>

294
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,155
<b>You really do believe that.</b>

295
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:14,740
<b>Dreykov's dead.</b>

296
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,307
<b>It took almost destroying the entire city
just to get to him.</b>

297
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:19,065
<b>If you're so sure,
then tell me what happened.</b>

298
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,704
<b>Tell me exactly.</b>

299
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:22,664
<b>We rigged bombs.</b>

300
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,333
<b>- Who's "we"?
- Clint Barton.</b>

301
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,544
<b>Killing Dreykov was the final step
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.</b>

302
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,089
<b>Simple as that?</b>

303
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,177
<b>Yeah, sure, "simple."</b>

304
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,801
<b>That's what I'd call imploding
a 5-story building</b>

305
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,933
<b>and then shooting it out
with the Hungarian Special Forces.</b>

306
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:44,144
<b>Took 10 days in hiding
before we could even get out of Budapest.</b>

307
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,896
<b>And you checked the body?</b>

308
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:47,648
<b>Confirmed the kill?</b>

309
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:52,986
<b>There was no body left to check.</b>

310
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,782
<b>You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.</b>

311
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,865
<b>Where are we trying to get?</b>

312
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,887
<b>Motorbike! East side
of the building.</b>

313
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,294
<b>I got you!</b>

314
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,007
<b>No!</b>

315
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,777
<b>Hey.</b>

316
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,987
<b>Don't move. You're hurt.</b>

317
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,364
<b>Let me help you.</b>

318
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,464
<b>I don't wanna do this.</b>

319
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,760
<b>- What are you doing?
- He's making me.</b>

320
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,625
<b>Do you believe me now?</b>

321
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:56,545
<b>How many others?</b>

322
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,088
<b>Enough.</b>

323
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:11,973
<b>Which one's yours?</b>

324
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,478
<b>Black. Brown seat.</b>

325
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:15,522
<b>Where are my keys?</b>

326
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:20,986
<b>Any day now.</b>

327
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:03,892
<b>You can't just steal a guy's car.</b>

328
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,824
<b>So you want me to chase him down
and un-steal it?</b>

329
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,870
<b>- Okay. Any time now, please.
- Shut up.</b>

330
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,573
<b>Okay, you got a plan,</b>

331
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,199
<b>or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?</b>

332
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,766
<b>Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.</b>

333
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:52,202
<b>That's a shit plan.</b>

334
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,091
<b>You're welcome.</b>

335
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:20,647
<b>Oh, shit. He's back.</b>

336
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,286
<b>Put your seat belt on.</b>

337
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:35,662
<b>You're such a mom.</b>

338
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,112
<b>Natasha, no.</b>

339
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:11,323
<b>I think I'm bleeding. I'm...</b>

340
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,285
<b>No. Not now, trust me.</b>

341
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:08,839
<b>You okay?</b>

342
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,717
<b>Yeah. Great plan.</b>

343
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,470
<b>I love the part
where I almost bled to death.</b>

344
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,432
<b>This is cozy.</b>

345
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,185
<b>Barton and I spent 2 days
hiding out up here.</b>

346
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,936
<b>That must have been fun.</b>

347
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:26,064
<b>Who the hell is that guy?</b>

348
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,608
<b>Dreykov's special project.</b>

349
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,152
<b>He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.</b>

350
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,445
<b>It's like fighting a mirror.</b>

351
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:34,281
<b>Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.</b>

352
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,116
<b>This doesn't make any sense.</b>

353
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,745
<b>Well, the truth rarely makes sense
when you omit key details.</b>

354
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,873
<b>What is that supposed to mean?</b>

355
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,000
<b>You didn't say one word
about Dreykov's daughter.</b>

356
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:47,711
<b>You killed her.</b>

357
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,755
<b>I had to.</b>

358
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,716
<b>I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.</b>

359
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:56,651
<b>We need confirmation
Dreykov's in the building.</b>

360
00:43:58,305 --> 00:43:59,705
<b>His car is pulling up now.</b>

361
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,576
<b>Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.</b>

362
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,413
<b>I needed her to be sure.</b>

363
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,187
<b>Natasha, we clear?</b>

364
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,418
<b>All clear.</b>

365
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:35,050
<b>And here you are, not so sure.</b>

366
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,719
<b>I needed out.</b>

367
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,028
<b>The Red Room's still active. Where is it?</b>

368
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,196
<b>I have no idea.</b>

369
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:59,116
<b>He moves location constantly.</b>

370
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:03,745
<b>And every widow is sedated
on entry and exit for maximum security.</b>

371
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:08,458
<b>I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.</b>

372
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:12,171
<b>Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger
if you want to stay hidden.</b>

373
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,506
<b>I mean, the clue is in the name.</b>

374
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:15,966
<b>Dreykov kills you,</b>

375
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:18,886
<b>one of the big ones comes to avenge you.</b>

376
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,387
<b>Wait, what are the big ones?</b>

377
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:24,933
<b>Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.</b>

378
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:29,605
<b>Where did you think I was all this time?</b>

379
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:36,695
<b>I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.</b>

380
00:45:38,488 --> 00:45:40,115
<b>And you just never made contact again?</b>

381
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,159
<b>Honestly, I thought
you didn't wanna see me.</b>

382
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,870
<b>Bullshit.</b>

383
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:47,706
<b>You just didn't want
your baby sister to tag along,</b>

384
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,673
<b>whilst you saved the world
with the cool kids.</b>

385
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,710
<b>You weren't really my sister.</b>

386
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,591
<b>And the Avengers
aren't really your family.</b>

387
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,290
<b>- Why do you always do that thing?
- Do what?</b>

388
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:02,763
<b>The thing you do when you're fighting.</b>

389
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,265
<b>The... Like, the...</b>

390
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,185
<b>This thing that you do</b>

391
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,395
<b>when you whip your hair
when you're fighting</b>

392
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,022
<b>with the arm and the hair.</b>

393
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,525
<b>And you do, like,
a fighting pose.</b>

394
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,151
<b>It's a...</b>

395
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:18,028
<b>It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.</b>

396
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:20,113
<b>I'm not a poser.</b>

397
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,115
<b>Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,</b>

398
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:24,952
<b>but it does look like
you think everyone's looking at you, like,</b>

399
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:26,119
<b>all the time.</b>

400
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,623
<b>All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good</b>

401
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,210
<b>to make up for all the pain
and suffering that we caused.</b>

402
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:35,754
<b>Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.</b>

403
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:41,051
<b>Well, then you were fooling yourself</b>

404
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,556
<b>because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.</b>

405
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,934
<b>Except I'm not the one
that's on the cover of a magazine.</b>

406
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,311
<b>I'm not the killer
that little girls call their hero.</b>

407
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,831
<b>That gas,</b>

408
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:13,250
<b>the counteragent,</b>

409
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,169
<b>it was synthesized in secret</b>

410
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:18,005
<b>by an older widow
from Melina's generation.</b>

411
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:21,550
<b>I was on the mission to retrieve it,
and she exposed me</b>

412
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:25,554
<b>and I killed the widow that freed me.</b>

413
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,306
<b>Did you have a choice?</b>

414
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:30,267
<b>What you experienced
was psychological conditioning.</b>

415
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,813
<b>I'm talking about chemically
altering brain functions.</b>

416
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,191
<b>They're two completely different things.</b>

417
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:41,612
<b>You're fully conscious,
but you don't know which part is you.</b>

418
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,405
<b>I'm still not sure.</b>

419
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,875
<b>- Is that all there is left?
- Mmm-hmm.</b>

420
00:47:55,834 --> 00:48:00,047
<b>It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov
and his network of widows.</b>

421
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,134
<b>He takes more every day.</b>

422
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,095
<b>Children who don't have anyone
to protect them.</b>

423
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:08,542
<b>Just like us when we were small.</b>

424
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,642
<b>Maybe one in 20 survives the training,
becomes a widow.</b>

425
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,185
<b>The rest, he kills.</b>

426
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:16,146
<b>To him, we are just things.</b>

427
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:20,567
<b>Weapons with no face
that he can just throw away.</b>

428
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,488
<b>Because there is always more.</b>

429
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,325
<b>And no one's even looking for him,
thanks to you and Alexei.</b>

430
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:30,118
<b>Alexei?</b>

431
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,330
<b>"Dad."</b>

432
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:46,927
<b>Did you ever look
for your parents? Your real ones?</b>

433
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:52,766
<b>Well, my mom abandoned me
in the street like garbage.</b>

434
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:57,271
<b>What about you?</b>

435
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:01,942
<b>They destroyed my birth certificate,
so I reinvented it.</b>

436
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,070
<b>My parents still live in Ohio.</b>

437
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,073
<b>My sister moved out west.</b>

438
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,157
<b>Is that right?</b>

439
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,868
<b>You're a science teacher.</b>

440
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:15,873
<b>You're working part-time, though,
especially after you had your son.</b>

441
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:18,709
<b>Your husband, he renovates houses.</b>

442
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,170
<b>That is not my story.</b>

443
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,046
<b>What is your story?</b>

444
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:30,012
<b>I never let myself be alone
long enough to think about it.</b>

445
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,935
<b>Did you ever wish for kids?</b>

446
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,274
<b>I want a dog.</b>

447
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:49,948
<b>Where you gonna go?</b>

448
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,700
<b>I don't know.</b>

449
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:56,455
<b>I don't really have
anywhere to go back to,</b>

450
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:58,123
<b>so I guess anywhere.</b>

451
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,465
<b>- Don't.
- Don't what?</b>

452
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,092
<b>You're going to
give me some big hero speech,</b>

453
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,177
<b>I can feel it.</b>

454
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,096
<b>Speeches aren't really my thing.</b>

455
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,181
<b>Huh.</b>

456
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,558
<b>It was more like an invitation.</b>

457
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,187
<b>To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?</b>

458
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:21,813
<b>Yeah.</b>

459
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,233
<b>Even though the Red Room
is impossible to find</b>

460
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:26,360
<b>and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?</b>

461
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,569
<b>Yeah.</b>

462
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:30,572
<b>That sounds like a shitload of work.</b>

463
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:31,949
<b>Yup.</b>

464
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:36,954
<b>Could be fun, though.</b>

465
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:39,373
<b>Yup.</b>

466
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:47,422
<b>I saw where he put the keys.</b>

467
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:51,009
<b>Top drawer, green cabinet.</b>

468
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:03,021
<b>You know, this is
the first piece of clothing</b>

469
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,606
<b>I've ever bought for myself.</b>

470
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:07,985
<b>That?</b>

471
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:09,570
<b>Yeah. You don't like it?</b>

472
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:11,280
<b>Is that like a...</b>

473
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,365
<b>Is it army surplus, or...</b>

474
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:14,992
<b>Okay, it has a lot of pockets.</b>

475
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:17,703
<b>But I use them all the time,</b>

476
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:20,080
<b>and I made some of my own
modifications.</b>

477
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:21,874
<b>- Oh, yeah?
- Whatever.</b>

478
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:24,251
<b>Shut up. The point is, I've never...</b>

479
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,713
<b>I've never had control
over my own life before, and now I do.</b>

480
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,548
<b>I want to do things.</b>

481
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:31,508
<b>Hmm...</b>

482
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:32,968
<b>I like your vest.</b>

483
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,846
<b>I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?</b>

484
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,139
<b>It's good. Yes. I like it.</b>

485
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:40,684
<b>And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.</b>

486
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,887
<b>I really don't know where
the Red Room is, though.</b>

487
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,984
<b>- I'm sorry.
- I know.</b>

488
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,987
<b>But I think I know somebody who does.</b>

489
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:53,155
<b>Oh, yeah? Who?</b>

490
00:51:53,864 --> 00:51:55,490
<b>We're gonna need a jet.</b>

491
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,619
<b>I said we needed a jet.</b>

492
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,538
<b>Yeah, you know what you didn't give me?
Time.</b>

493
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,290
<b>Or money. I'm not made of jets.</b>

494
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,030
<b>I thought you were
supposed to be the best.</b>

495
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,043
<b>Like a real pro.</b>

496
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,450
<b>Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.</b>

497
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:09,426
<b>Was the free flat
and lifetime supply of kissel</b>

498
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:11,131
<b>- not to your liking?
- Ha!</b>

499
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,883
<b>Don't let her wind you up.</b>

500
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,469
<b>No, I take exception
to impugning my professionalism.</b>

501
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:19,473
<b>Well, you did set me up with a generator
that crapped out after 6 hours.</b>

502
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,892
<b>You, too, huh? Tag team.</b>

503
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:25,145
<b>Aw, he's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.</b>

504
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:26,772
<b>Where's the rest?</b>

505
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:34,613
<b>Voilà.</b>

506
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,448
<b>Ooh.</b>

507
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,214
<b>Oh, I stashed that, like, 5 years ago.</b>

508
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,496
<b>How is it?</b>

509
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:45,874
<b>It's dry.
It's really dry.</b>

510
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:53,519
<b>You know, you're getting dangerously close
to running out your tab.</b>

511
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,135
<b>Supplies I can tally, but you bring me
attention from the authorities,</b>

512
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,846
<b>all my prices go up.</b>

513
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:02,049
<b>What's that supposed to mean?</b>

514
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:05,185
<b>Your mate, Secretary Ross,
has been sniffing around my affairs</b>

515
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,313
<b>to the point at which I've got
contacts declining my calls.</b>

516
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,399
<b>I'm a private contractor.</b>

517
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:13,402
<b>You are sensitive.</b>

518
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,112
<b>You're a very annoying individual.</b>

519
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:19,241
<b>- I'll make it up to you.
- Mmm-hmm.</b>

520
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,160
<b>That's what you say every time.</b>

521
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,627
<b>So, I have the nuclear code.</b>

522
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:34,256
<b>But there he is.</b>

523
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:38,969
<b>- Captain America!
- America.</b>

524
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:45,267
<b>Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!</b>

525
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,645
<b>I grab hold of his shield</b>

526
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:54,526
<b>and face to face, it's a test of strength.</b>

527
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:01,825
<b>Oh... Oh, no.</b>

528
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,703
<b>Oh...</b>

529
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,207
<b>That guy think he going to beat me.</b>

530
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,876
<b>Anyway, this shield, you know,
that he carries with him</b>

531
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:13,837
<b>like a precious baby blanket, you know?</b>

532
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:16,173
<b>I use it to my advantage.
I take it</b>

533
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,540
<b>and I push him out the window.</b>

534
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:20,052
<b>And I make my escape. Huh?</b>

535
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:22,262
<b>What year was this?</b>

536
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,891
<b>I don't know.
Like, '83, '84.</b>

537
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:27,059
<b>I know.</b>

538
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:30,437
<b>Captain America was
still frozen in ice then.</b>

539
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,777
<b>Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?</b>

540
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,792
<b>Oh, no.</b>

541
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:53,961
<b>Uh-oh.</b>

542
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,464
<b>Aw, look at the big bear.</b>

543
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,299
<b>Gonna cry, little girl?</b>

544
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:14,166
<b>Today is your lucky day, Alexei.</b>

545
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:18,444
<b>Move to the door on the south wall.</b>

546
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,318
<b>Go left.</b>

547
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:43,820
<b>Just don't make a scene.</b>

548
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,255
<b>You made a scene, didn't you?</b>

549
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,893
<b>What now?</b>

550
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,967
<b>We're gettin' you outta here.</b>

551
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,360
<b>Go to the upper level.</b>

552
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,131
<b>Move your ass, super soldier.</b>

553
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:57,686
<b>He's never going to make it.</b>

554
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:59,271
<b>Get me closer.</b>

555
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:01,815
<b>You got a better idea?</b>

556
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:07,029
<b>Natasha.</b>

557
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,209
<b>Such a poser.</b>

558
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:46,276
<b>Seriously?</b>

559
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:48,862
<b>Whoo!</b>

560
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:50,739
<b>Sorry!</b>

561
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,118
<b>What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?</b>

562
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:56,954
<b>Back up!</b>

563
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:59,790
<b>We're both doing
a really good job.</b>

564
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,926
<b>No.</b>

565
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:14,721
<b>Okay. Enough of this.</b>

566
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:32,364
<b>Ha!</b>

567
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:42,249
<b>Whoa...</b>

568
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,423
<b>This would be a cool way to die.</b>

569
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,470
<b>Tell me that's a good sign for us!</b>

570
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:56,763
<b>Move your ass!</b>

571
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:22,831
<b>Get us outta here!</b>

572
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,625
<b>Huh.</b>

573
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:10,420
<b>Wait!</b>

574
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:38,115
<b>Yes!</b>

575
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,452
<b>I need some help up here!</b>

576
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,342
<b>Oh, that was exciting.</b>

577
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:02,556
<b>Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.</b>

578
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,143
<b>Oh, you can't hear me, huh?</b>

579
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,312
<b>Okay.</b>

580
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,523
<b>Ah...</b>

581
01:02:12,149 --> 01:02:13,150
<b>Wow.</b>

582
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:18,197
<b>Okay.</b>

583
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,283
<b>Why the aggression, huh?</b>

584
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,535
<b>Is it your time of the month?</b>

585
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:27,122
<b>I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.</b>

586
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:28,498
<b>Or ovaries.</b>

587
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,031
<b>Yeah. That's what happens
when the Red Room</b>

588
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:32,563
<b>gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.</b>

589
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:37,174
<b>They kind of just go in and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs.</b>

590
01:02:37,341 --> 01:02:40,802
<b>They just get right in there
and they chop them all away.</b>

591
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:43,960
<b>- Everything out, so you can't have babies.
- Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!</b>

592
01:02:43,972 --> 01:02:46,475
<b>You don't have to get
so clinical and nasty.</b>

593
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:48,143
<b>Oh, well, I was about to talk about</b>

594
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,479
<b>- fallopian tubes, but okay.
- No.</b>

595
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:56,860
<b>It means so much to me
that you came back for me.</b>

596
01:02:57,027 --> 01:03:00,614
<b>No. No. You're gonna tell us
how to get to the Red Room.</b>

597
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:02,282
<b>Huh.</b>

598
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:04,159
<b>Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.</b>

599
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:05,744
<b>Trust me, this isn't pleasure.</b>

600
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:09,957
<b>Little Natasha,
all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.</b>

601
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:13,252
<b>I chose to go west to become an Avenger.</b>

602
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,379
<b>'Cause they treated me like family.</b>

603
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:17,381
<b>Really? Family?</b>

604
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:19,842
<b>Well, where are they now?</b>

605
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:22,678
<b>Where is that family now?</b>

606
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,847
<b>Tell me where the Red Room is.</b>

607
01:03:27,182 --> 01:03:29,977
<b>I have no idea.</b>

608
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,228
<b>Okay?</b>

609
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,860
<b>Come on. You and Dreykov were like...</b>

610
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:39,027
<b>- Dreykov?
- Yeah.</b>

611
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:41,530
<b>General Dreykov, my friend, huh?</b>

612
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:44,032
<b>Gives me glory...</b>

613
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,202
<b>Soviet Union's first
and only super soldier.</b>

614
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:50,539
<b>I could have been more famous
than Captain America.</b>

615
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:54,126
<b>Then he buries me in Ohio
on that stupid mission.</b>

616
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:55,711
<b>3 years!</b>

617
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:58,839
<b>So tedious, boring me to tears.</b>

618
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,260
<b>No offense, huh?</b>

619
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:06,763
<b>Then puts me in prison
for the rest of my life. Why, huh?</b>

620
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,461
<b>Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?</b>

621
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:11,143
<b>'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.</b>

622
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,966
<b>Or maybe I don't like
his hair or something</b>

623
01:04:12,978 --> 01:04:14,384
<b>and I say something casually about that.</b>

624
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:15,397
<b>Maybe, you know,</b>

625
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,524
<b>I want the Party
to feel actually like a party</b>

626
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:20,068
<b>instead of this sourpuss organization.</b>

627
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:22,404
<b>But instead, no.</b>

628
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:25,574
<b>He puts me in prison
for the rest of my life.</b>

629
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,868
<b>He just runs off and hides, huh?</b>

630
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,788
<b>I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...</b>

631
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,792
<b>I'm not the one who killed his daughter.</b>

632
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:39,075
<b>Can we throw him
out the window now?</b>

633
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,077
<b>I think we should wait
till we get to a higher altitude.</b>

634
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:42,090
<b>All right.</b>

635
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:46,124
<b>Wait, Mom Melina?</b>

636
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,138
<b>We thought she was dead.</b>

637
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:51,016
<b>You cannot kill a fox that swift.</b>

638
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:52,351
<b>- Ew.
- What?</b>

639
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:57,105
<b>She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.</b>

640
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:59,775
<b>She worked directly for Dreykov
far more than I ever did.</b>

641
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:03,403
<b>Wait. Are you telling me that Melina
is working for the Red Room present day?</b>

642
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,822
<b>She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.</b>

643
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:07,741
<b>Uh...</b>

644
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:10,661
<b>I don't think we have enough
fuel for St. Petersburg.</b>

645
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:12,412
<b>No, we're good. We'll make it.</b>

646
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:14,039
<b>Okay.</b>

647
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:36,603
<b>You should've brought
the Avengers' superjet.</b>

648
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,734
<b>I swear, if I hear
one more word from him,</b>

649
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:45,141
<b>- I will kick him in the face.
- He's the worst.</b>

650
01:05:45,237 --> 01:05:46,822
<b>Natasha.</b>

651
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,365
<b>Natasha. Natasha.</b>

652
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:51,451
<b>Come here, I want to ask you something.</b>

653
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,537
<b>- Come, it's important.
- What?</b>

654
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,626
<b>Did he talk to you about me?</b>

655
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,004
<b>What?</b>

656
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:06,175
<b>Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?</b>

657
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:07,497
<b>Who? What are you talking about?</b>

658
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,761
<b>Captain America.</b>

659
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:14,892
<b>My great adversary
in this theater of geopolitical conflict.</b>

660
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,894
<b>Not so much a nemesis.</b>

661
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:18,979
<b>More like a contemporary, you know?
Coequal.</b>

662
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:21,506
<b>I always thought there was
a great deal of mutual respect...</b>

663
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,567
<b>Wait. You haven't seen
either one of us in 20 years</b>

664
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:25,277
<b>and you're gonna ask me about you?</b>

665
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,572
<b>What is with this tension?</b>

666
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:31,825
<b>Did I do something wrong?</b>

667
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:34,995
<b>Is that a serious question?</b>

668
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:38,248
<b>I only ever loved you girls.</b>

669
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:40,918
<b>I did my best to make sure
you would succeed</b>

670
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:42,920
<b>to achieve your fullest potential,</b>

671
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:44,910
<b>- and everything worked out.
- Everything worked out?</b>

672
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:47,299
<b>Yes. For you, yes.</b>

673
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:51,428
<b>We accomplished our mission in Ohio.</b>

674
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:54,973
<b>Yelena, you went on to become
the greatest child assassin</b>

675
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:56,350
<b>the world has ever known.</b>

676
01:06:56,517 --> 01:07:00,479
<b>No one can match your efficiency,
your ruthlessness.</b>

677
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:02,606
<b>And Natasha,</b>

678
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,653
<b>not just a spy,
not just toppling regimes,</b>

679
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:09,947
<b>destroying empires from within,</b>

680
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,282
<b>but an Avenger.</b>

681
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,161
<b>You both have killed</b>

682
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,705
<b>so many people.</b>

683
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:22,960
<b>Your ledgers must be dripping,
just gushing red.</b>

684
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:25,712
<b>I couldn't be more proud of you.</b>

685
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,468
<b>Okay. You can... No.</b>

686
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:33,387
<b>Let go of me now.</b>

687
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:35,347
<b>You smell really bad.</b>

688
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:42,229
<b>So, are we there yet?</b>

689
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:44,439
<b>You'll know when we're there.</b>

690
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,151
<b>Slight right.</b>

691
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:50,696
<b>Straight on.</b>

692
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,531
<b>Right.</b>

693
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:56,159
<b>Slight right.</b>

694
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,496
<b>Oh, very good, my darling.</b>

695
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:02,833
<b>Yes, very good.</b>

696
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,086
<b>Yes, very good, my darling.</b>

697
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:21,727
<b>Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.</b>

698
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:13,570
<b>Honey, we're home.</b>

699
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:26,500
<b>Come on, girls.</b>

700
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:39,304
<b>Welcome to my humble abode.</b>

701
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,723
<b>Make yourself at home.</b>

702
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:45,936
<b>Let's have a drink.</b>

703
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:02,452
<b>Hey, no funny business.</b>

704
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,873
<b>I am putting away my weapon.</b>

705
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:31,011
<b>Are there
any booby traps around here?</b>

706
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,262
<b>Anything we need to know about?</b>

707
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:33,914
<b>I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.</b>

708
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:35,819
<b>You didn't raise us at all.</b>

709
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:39,448
<b>Oh, maybe so.</b>

710
01:10:39,823 --> 01:10:43,118
<b>But if you got soft,
it wasn't on my watch.</b>

711
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,351
<b>Let's drink.</b>

712
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:10,437
<b>Okay.</b>

713
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:22,991
<b>Still fits.</b>

714
01:11:24,535 --> 01:11:26,203
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

715
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:30,624
<b>I never washed it once.</b>

716
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,376
<b>Come and drink.</b>

717
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:38,340
<b>Rise, you workers of salvation.</b>

718
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:43,220
<b>Family</b>

719
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:45,848
<b>back together again.</b>

720
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,642
<b>- Mmm.
- Seeing as our</b>

721
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:49,893
<b>family construct</b>

722
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,855
<b>was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted 3 years,</b>

723
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:57,359
<b>I don't think that we can use
this term anymore, can we?</b>

724
01:11:57,526 --> 01:11:59,987
<b>Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...</b>

725
01:12:00,153 --> 01:12:03,282
<b>Okay. A reunion then, huh?</b>

726
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:04,533
<b>And, uh...</b>

727
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,119
<b>I want to say something
right off the bat.</b>

728
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:09,413
<b>You haven't aged a day, huh?</b>

729
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,710
<b>You're just as beautiful and as supple
as the day they staged our marriage.</b>

730
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,671
<b>You got fat.</b>

731
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:20,966
<b>But still good.</b>

732
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,886
<b>I just got out of prison. I, uh...</b>

733
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:27,366
<b>- I have a lot of energy.
- Oh!</b>

734
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,349
<b>Please don't do that.</b>

735
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,437
<b>So, here's what's gonna happen.</b>

736
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,022
<b>Natasha, don't slouch.</b>

737
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,900
<b>- I'm not slouching.
- Yes, yes, you are.</b>

738
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:38,984
<b>I don't slouch.</b>

739
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:40,348
<b>You're going to get a back hunch.</b>

740
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,683
<b>- Listen to your mother.
- Oh, my God, this...</b>

741
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:42,696
<b>Up, up.</b>

742
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,198
<b>All right, enough. All of you.</b>

743
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,116
<b>I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.</b>

744
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:47,856
<b>- Here's what's gonna happen...
- I don't want any food.</b>

745
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:50,025
<b>Eat a little something,
Yelena, for God's sake.</b>

746
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:51,997
<b>You're gonna tell us
the location of the Red Room.</b>

747
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:58,504
<b>You know, it's like when you told them</b>

748
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:00,714
<b>that they could stay up late
to catch Santa Claus.</b>

749
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:03,038
<b>What? That was fun. You know,
"He come down the chimney, girls."</b>

750
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,384
<b>"Look out. Where is he?"</b>

751
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:07,346
<b>You wait for him,
and then when the cookies are gone,</b>

752
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:09,389
<b>then you see he's there.</b>

753
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:11,433
<b>No, no. What? I want them</b>

754
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,237
<b>- to follow their dreams.
- No good.</b>

755
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,354
<b>Reach for the stars, girls.</b>

756
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:18,023
<b>Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.</b>

757
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:22,069
<b>You can't defeat a man
who commands the very will of others.</b>

758
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:26,114
<b>You never saw the culmination
of what we started in America.</b>

759
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:27,616
<b>Nor did you.</b>

760
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:34,498
<b>Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.</b>

761
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:42,631
<b>Come in.</b>

762
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:51,515
<b>Did that pig just open the door?</b>

763
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,767
<b>Yes. It did.</b>

764
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:56,687
<b>Good boy, Alexei.
Good boy.</b>

765
01:13:57,688 --> 01:13:59,481
<b>You named a pig after me?</b>

766
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:01,859
<b>You don't see the resemblance?</b>

767
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:07,281
<b>See, he sits just like dog.</b>

768
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:09,700
<b>Amazing. Now, watch.</b>

769
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:11,267
<b>It's a little weird, to me.</b>

770
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:12,828
<b>Stop breathing.</b>

771
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:21,545
<b>We infiltrated
the North Institute in Ohio.</b>

772
01:14:21,712 --> 01:14:23,326
<b>It was a front
for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.</b>

773
01:14:23,338 --> 01:14:26,592
<b>Actually, it was Hydra scientists
at that time.</b>

774
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:28,456
<b>In conjunction with
the Winter Soldier project,</b>

775
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:31,346
<b>they had dissected
and deconstructed the human brain</b>

776
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:36,185
<b>to create the first and only
cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.</b>

777
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:37,769
<b>Was the hub for cognition.</b>

778
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:41,231
<b>Voluntary motor movement,
procedural learning.</b>

779
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,528
<b>We didn't steal weaponry or technology.</b>

780
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:49,531
<b>We stole the key to unlocking free will.</b>

781
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:56,371
<b>What are you doing?</b>

782
01:14:56,496 --> 01:15:00,167
<b>Oh, I am explaining
that the science is now so exact,</b>

783
01:15:00,334 --> 01:15:02,544
<b>the subject can be instructed
to stop breathing</b>

784
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,588
<b>and has no choice but to obey.</b>

785
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:06,355
<b>Okay, you made your point.
That's enough.</b>

786
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:09,301
<b>Yes, all right. Well, don't worry,
Alexei could've survived</b>

787
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:12,054
<b>11 more seconds without oxygen.</b>

788
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:15,015
<b>Good boy. Now, you go back,
back home where it's safe.</b>

789
01:15:16,558 --> 01:15:18,644
<b>You go. You go back home,
back home where it's safe.</b>

790
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:21,063
<b>Good boy, Alexei.</b>

791
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:24,858
<b>The world functions on a higher level
when it is controlled.</b>

792
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:29,404
<b>Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents
planted around the globe.</b>

793
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:31,698
<b>And do you know who they test it on?</b>

794
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:33,116
<b>Hmm...</b>

795
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,952
<b>No. That's not my department.</b>

796
01:15:35,035 --> 01:15:36,912
<b>Ah, come on, come on.</b>

797
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:38,956
<b>- Don't lie to them. Hmm?
- I'm not lying.</b>

798
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:40,582
<b>You're Dreykov's architect, huh?</b>

799
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:41,750
<b>What were you?</b>

800
01:15:41,834 --> 01:15:43,573
<b>If I was his architect,
you were his partner.</b>

801
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:44,699
<b>You were his business partner.</b>

802
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:46,076
<b>No, no, no. I was patsy!</b>

803
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:48,382
<b>- Don't give me that...
- He sell me ideology.</b>

804
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:49,871
<b>- Stop with the politics.
- All the while, bigger...</b>

805
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:52,678
<b>Shut up! You are an idiot.</b>

806
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:58,767
<b>And you're a coward.</b>

807
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:02,729
<b>You're a coward.</b>

808
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:07,025
<b>And our family was never real,
so there's nothing to hold on to.</b>

809
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:09,820
<b>We're moving on.</b>

810
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:12,322
<b>Never family, huh?</b>

811
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:15,158
<b>In my heart, I am simple man.</b>

812
01:16:16,076 --> 01:16:19,329
<b>And I think that for a couple
deep undercover Russian agents</b>

813
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:21,540
<b>I think we did pretty great
as parents, huh?</b>

814
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:25,169
<b>Yes, we had our orders,
and we played our roles to perfection.</b>

815
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:28,005
<b>Who cares? That wasn't real.</b>

816
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,716
<b>- What?
- That wasn't real. Who cares?</b>

817
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,634
<b>Don't say that.</b>

818
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:35,721
<b>Please don't say that.
It was real.</b>

819
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:39,433
<b>It was real to me.
You are my mother.</b>

820
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:42,352
<b>You were my real mother.</b>

821
01:16:42,519 --> 01:16:45,147
<b>The closest thing I ever had to one.</b>

822
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:49,109
<b>The best part of my life was fake.</b>

823
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:52,946
<b>And none of you told me.</b>

824
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:58,035
<b>And those agents</b>

825
01:16:58,118 --> 01:17:00,829
<b>you chemically subjugated
around the globe?</b>

826
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:04,458
<b>That was me.</b>

827
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:07,753
<b>Mmm.</b>

828
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:12,633
<b>And you, you got out.</b>

829
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:15,177
<b>Dreykov made sure no one could escape.</b>

830
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:18,055
<b>Are you gonna say anything?</b>

831
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,601
<b>No.</b>

832
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:25,062
<b>Don't touch me.</b>

833
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:29,399
<b>Yelena.</b>

834
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:30,984
<b>No.</b>

835
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,324
<b>- I had no idea.
- It's okay, it's okay.</b>

836
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:39,368
<b>I'll go talk to her.</b>

837
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:57,928
<b>I came in here
because I didn't want to talk.</b>

838
01:17:59,638 --> 01:18:00,764
<b>Okay.</b>

839
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:03,934
<b>We, uh... We just sit.</b>

840
01:18:08,772 --> 01:18:10,274
<b>We just sit.</b>

841
01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:20,993
<b>Where are you going?</b>

842
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,495
<b>- To do this myself.
- Don't. You won't survive.</b>

843
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:25,998
<b>I wish I could believe that you cared.</b>

844
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:29,001
<b>But you're not even the first mother
that abandoned me.</b>

845
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:31,295
<b>No, you weren't abandoned.</b>

846
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,422
<b>You were selected by a program</b>

847
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:35,507
<b>that assessed
the genetic potential in infants.</b>

848
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:47,144
<b>I was taken?</b>

849
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:51,064
<b>I believe a bargain was struck,
your family paid off.</b>

850
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:54,109
<b>But your mother,
she never stopped looking for you.</b>

851
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:57,196
<b>She was like you in that way.
She was</b>

852
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:58,906
<b>relentless.</b>

853
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,283
<b>What happened to her?</b>

854
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:04,745
<b>Dreykov had her killed.</b>

855
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:08,874
<b>Her existence threatened
to uncover the Red Room.</b>

856
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:12,336
<b>Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian</b>

857
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:13,619
<b>wouldn't warrant an execution,</b>

858
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,381
<b>but, as I said, she was relentless.</b>

859
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:21,970
<b>I thought about her every day of my life.</b>

860
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:29,394
<b>Whether or not I admitted it to myself,
I did.</b>

861
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:34,233
<b>I've always found it best
not to look into the past.</b>

862
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:46,870
<b>Then why did you save this?</b>

863
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:06,723
<b>I remember this day.</b>

864
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:10,853
<b>We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter
and summer vacation all in one day.</b>

865
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:13,480
<b>- Different backdrops.
- Mmm.</b>

866
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:19,486
<b>I knew all the presents under the tree
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.</b>

867
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:21,321
<b>I wanted to open every single one...</b>

868
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:27,536
<b>so just for a second it would feel real.</b>

869
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,496
<b>Let's stop this.</b>

870
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:38,547
<b>Why you doing this?</b>

871
01:20:39,756 --> 01:20:43,635
<b>Why does a mouse born in a cage
run on that little wheel?</b>

872
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:46,430
<b>Do you know I was cycled
through the Red Room</b>

873
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:49,099
<b>four times before you were even born?</b>

874
01:20:49,266 --> 01:20:50,684
<b>Those walls are all I know.</b>

875
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,687
<b>I was never given a choice.</b>

876
01:20:54,104 --> 01:20:56,398
<b>But you're not a mouse, Melina.</b>

877
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:02,029
<b>You were just born in a cage,
but that's not your fault.</b>

878
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,952
<b>Tell me, how did you keep your heart?</b>

879
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:17,085
<b>Pain only makes us stronger.</b>

880
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:20,005
<b>Didn't you tell us that?</b>

881
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:24,426
<b>What you taught me kept me alive.</b>

882
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:30,140
<b>I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.</b>

883
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:32,267
<b>They'll be here any minute.</b>

884
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:39,733
<b>So, there I am
ice fishing with my father.</b>

885
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:42,945
<b>It's very cold day
in this little ice shed.</b>

886
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:44,404
<b>Cold even for Russia, you know?</b>

887
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:47,324
<b>"Keep the vodka by the fire,"
my father would say to me.</b>

888
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,617
<b>Please stop talking.</b>

889
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,814
<b>- Please wait. Please wait.
- Please, no.</b>

890
01:21:49,826 --> 01:21:50,899
<b>Please, I don't want to talk.</b>

891
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:52,454
<b>Please. Please.</b>

892
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,791
<b>There is a reason why
I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.</b>

893
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:58,460
<b>I am reaching for fish.</b>

894
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:02,923
<b>Oh! I lose balance. Ah!</b>

895
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:04,007
<b>Splash!</b>

896
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:06,009
<b>My hands go in the river.</b>

897
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:10,180
<b>In this weather,
frostbite sets in quick.</b>

898
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,351
<b>My father, he go toilet on my hands.</b>

899
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:15,644
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

900
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:20,607
<b>Urine is 35 degrees Celsius,
staves off the frostbite.</b>

901
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:22,276
<b>How is this relevant?</b>

902
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,361
<b>You know,</b>

903
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:26,154
<b>fathers.</b>

904
01:22:28,699 --> 01:22:31,285
<b>No. No.</b>

905
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:35,455
<b>You have done nothing
but tell me how bored you were.</b>

906
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:39,835
<b>I was the chore,
the job you didn't want to do.</b>

907
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,503
<b>To me?</b>

908
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:44,756
<b>To me, you were everything.</b>

909
01:22:47,426 --> 01:22:50,804
<b>Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.</b>

910
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:53,724
<b>The only thing you care about
are your stupid glory days</b>

911
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:57,144
<b>as the Crimson Dynamo,
and no one wants to hear about it.</b>

912
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:05,652
<b>It's the Red Guardian.</b>

913
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:06,904
<b>Get out.</b>

914
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:08,864
<b>Get out!</b>

915
01:23:18,373 --> 01:23:20,876
<b>I can't remember.</b>

916
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:25,881
<b>If I cried.</b>

917
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:31,678
<b>When I read about his widowed bride.</b>

918
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:36,934
<b>Something touched me deep inside.</b>

919
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,268
<b>The day.</b>

920
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:42,231
<b>The music.</b>

921
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,483
<b>Died.</b>

922
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,694
<b>And they were singing.</b>

923
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,906
<b>- Bye.
- Bye.</b>

924
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:53,659
<b>- Miss American Pie.
- American Pie.</b>

925
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:56,745
<b>Drove my Chevy to the levee.</b>

926
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:59,540
<b>- But the levee was dry.
- Was dry.</b>

927
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,459
<b>Them good old boys.</b>

928
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:04,962
<b>Drinking whiskey.</b>

929
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:07,881
<b>Singing.</b>

930
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:12,261
<b>"This will be the day that I die".</b>

931
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,472
<b>"This'll be the day..."</b>

932
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:36,368
<b>Get down.</b>

933
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,210
<b>They think...</b>

934
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:46,438
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

935
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,540
<b>Let's not keep him waiting.</b>

936
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:33,068
<b>Request clearance for landing.</b>

937
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:36,655
<b>Melina?</b>

938
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:43,375
<b>We're touching down in one minute.</b>

939
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:46,123
<b>Then why are we still going up?</b>

940
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:51,795
<b>Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed
above the radar all these years.</b>

941
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,709
<b>My God.</b>

942
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:14,419
<b>Look at you.</b>

943
01:28:17,381 --> 01:28:18,382
<b>So, uh,</b>

944
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,592
<b>how was the family reunion?</b>

945
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:22,636
<b>Oh, it was awful.</b>

946
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:23,887
<b>They were clingy,</b>

947
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:26,098
<b>and too emotional, and needy.</b>

948
01:28:26,265 --> 01:28:28,642
<b>- Just like old times, huh?
- Hmm.</b>

949
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,227
<b>Yelena Belova.</b>

950
01:28:30,394 --> 01:28:32,104
<b>What's the deal with her?</b>

951
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:34,523
<b>She was the only one affected, right?</b>

952
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:36,233
<b>As far as I know, yes.</b>

953
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:39,361
<b>These gasses and antidotes,</b>

954
01:28:39,987 --> 01:28:42,614
<b>it's a pain in my ass.</b>

955
01:28:43,824 --> 01:28:46,159
<b>It's a problem. You need to sort it.</b>

956
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:47,578
<b>Hmm. I have nine pigs</b>

957
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:48,817
<b>that will require attending to
in my absence.</b>

958
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:52,040
<b>Don't give a shit about your pigs.</b>

959
01:28:58,255 --> 01:28:59,506
<b>Cut her brain out...</b>

960
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:03,010
<b>Hmm? Identify the weakness.</b>

961
01:29:12,561 --> 01:29:15,105
<b>This is a much less cool way to die.</b>

962
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,490
<b>Alexei.</b>

963
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,001
<b>What about Romanoff?</b>

964
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:37,461
<b>She's a traitor.</b>

965
01:29:38,337 --> 01:29:42,424
<b>She turned her back on her people.
On her blood.</b>

966
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:45,344
<b>She had nothing.</b>

967
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:49,306
<b>I gave her home.
I gave her love.</b>

968
01:29:49,806 --> 01:29:52,100
<b>Put that thing in her you do.</b>

969
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:54,353
<b>You know, uh, chemicals.</b>

970
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:58,524
<b>Turn her into one of your pigs.</b>

971
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:03,654
<b>Can you imagine what I could do
with an Avenger under my control?</b>

972
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,281
<b>Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?</b>

973
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:09,868
<b>When you look into the eyes
of a child you have raised,</b>

974
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:13,413
<b>no mask in the world can hide that.</b>

975
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:28,470
<b>Welcome home.</b>

976
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,140
<b>Now, now.</b>

977
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,602
<b>Don't go breaking my new toy.</b>

978
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:38,772
<b>Natasha.</b>

979
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:42,943
<b>I can't save us.</b>

980
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:45,741
<b>I need you to know that I'm sorry.</b>

981
01:30:45,904 --> 01:30:47,781
<b>I pledged my life to a cause.</b>

982
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:50,284
<b>You know, I thought
I was being very brave.</b>

983
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:51,577
<b>Possibly the bravest.</b>

984
01:30:51,743 --> 01:30:54,246
<b>But I wasn't being brave.</b>

985
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:55,956
<b>I was coward.</b>

986
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:03,213
<b>In Cuba,</b>

987
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:07,050
<b>when they came
and took you away from me...</b>

988
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:10,929
<b>No cause is worth that.</b>

989
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:15,851
<b>You should only sacrifice yourself</b>

990
01:31:16,727 --> 01:31:18,270
<b>for something...</b>

991
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:27,988
<b>How did you do that?</b>

992
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:31,033
<b>I designed these cells myself.</b>

993
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:35,412
<b>What?</b>

994
01:31:37,247 --> 01:31:38,248
<b>What?</b>

995
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:42,127
<b>I bared my soul to you
and it was just you the whole time?</b>

996
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:45,881
<b>Yes, I'm afraid so.
But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.</b>

997
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:49,051
<b>Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.</b>

998
01:31:49,218 --> 01:31:52,179
<b>You have a 2-inch blade
concealed in your beltline.</b>

999
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:53,347
<b>What?</b>

1000
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:58,519
<b>What are you going to do to me?</b>

1001
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:00,893
<b>Outside right hip.</b>

1002
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,217
<b>You couldn't have told me sooner?</b>

1003
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,385
<b>Don't throw a fit.</b>

1004
01:32:31,552 --> 01:32:32,912
<b>- There wasn't time.
- Okay, girls,</b>

1005
01:32:32,928 --> 01:32:34,179
<b>I'm having trouble hearing you,</b>

1006
01:32:34,263 --> 01:32:37,140
<b>but, Natasha,
there's something I need you to know.</b>

1007
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:41,979
<b>I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?</b>

1008
01:32:42,646 --> 01:32:45,566
<b>I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.</b>

1009
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:47,776
<b>You don't have earpiece.</b>

1010
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:49,486
<b>What?</b>

1011
01:32:49,653 --> 01:32:50,779
<b>No, she can't hear you.</b>

1012
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:52,386
<b>- You don't have earpiece.
- Why not?</b>

1013
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:53,931
<b>Because it wasn't part of the plan.</b>

1014
01:32:53,991 --> 01:32:55,534
<b>Oh, yeah?
Well, what was the plan?</b>

1015
01:32:56,243 --> 01:32:57,399
<b>So, once we're inside,</b>

1016
01:32:57,411 --> 01:32:59,451
<b>I'll activate my tracker
and Ross will come running.</b>

1017
01:32:59,496 --> 01:33:02,666
<b>You are aware that
you are still a global fugitive, yes?</b>

1018
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,627
<b>You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.</b>

1019
01:33:06,795 --> 01:33:10,090
<b>Instruct them to confine us on level zero.</b>

1020
01:33:10,257 --> 01:33:12,926
<b>Once I'm out,
I can activate the landing protocol,</b>

1021
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:14,511
<b>we can descend within the hour.</b>

1022
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:16,263
<b>Ah, problem.</b>

1023
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:19,016
<b>I only have one earpiece set.</b>

1024
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:20,934
<b>I'll give it to Yelena.</b>

1025
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:22,722
<b>Where did he take the vials?</b>

1026
01:33:22,853 --> 01:33:24,771
<b>Probably down to cold storage.</b>

1027
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:27,274
<b>Dreykov still has the widows
under his control,</b>

1028
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:30,027
<b>so you have to expose them
to this antidote.</b>

1029
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:33,405
<b>Yeah. Sure. Easy.</b>

1030
01:33:34,823 --> 01:33:35,908
<b>Is this your plan?</b>

1031
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:37,701
<b>My plan is to kill you.</b>

1032
01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:39,286
<b>I'm alive.</b>

1033
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,122
<b>So, what do we do now?</b>

1034
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,501
<b>What was my mother's name?</b>

1035
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:50,172
<b>Ah...</b>

1036
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:53,342
<b>Where we buried her,</b>

1037
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:55,844
<b>there was a tree...</b>

1038
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,888
<b>Um...</b>

1039
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,848
<b>A pink blossom.</b>

1040
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:01,725
<b>Beautiful.</b>

1041
01:34:01,892 --> 01:34:03,644
<b>And there was a tombstone</b>

1042
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:06,438
<b>with her name engraved on it.</b>

1043
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:08,732
<b>What was her name?</b>

1044
01:34:08,815 --> 01:34:10,317
<b>Ah.</b>

1045
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:16,031
<b>"Unknown."</b>

1046
01:34:18,075 --> 01:34:20,369
<b>You don't feel anything?</b>

1047
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:23,914
<b>You feel anything
when I killed your daughter?</b>

1048
01:34:24,081 --> 01:34:27,334
<b>Is this your haunted past?</b>

1049
01:34:29,419 --> 01:34:31,421
<b>Really?</b>

1050
01:34:40,973 --> 01:34:43,642
<b>Thank you, Natasha.</b>

1051
01:34:47,896 --> 01:34:50,482
<b>You gave me my greatest weapon.</b>

1052
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:55,320
<b>Say hello.</b>

1053
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:13,005
<b>When your bomb exploded,</b>

1054
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:15,716
<b>it nearly killed my Antonia.</b>

1055
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:23,307
<b>I had to put a chip
in the back of her neck.</b>

1056
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:25,809
<b>In the back of her neck.</b>

1057
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:28,187
<b>Look at her.</b>

1058
01:35:28,687 --> 01:35:30,898
<b>You find it difficult to look at her?</b>

1059
01:35:31,815 --> 01:35:33,150
<b>I do.</b>

1060
01:35:34,026 --> 01:35:36,653
<b>She... She watches everything</b>

1061
01:35:37,529 --> 01:35:38,739
<b>and she can do it.</b>

1062
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:41,325
<b>She's a perfect mimic.</b>

1063
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:46,246
<b>And she fights
just like all of your friends.</b>

1064
01:35:50,918 --> 01:35:52,503
<b>Can she hear me?</b>

1065
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:57,090
<b>What?</b>

1066
01:35:59,176 --> 01:36:01,303
<b>You want to make her feel better?</b>

1067
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:05,933
<b>You want to tell her you're sorry?</b>

1068
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:11,146
<b>Well, you should have thought of that
before you blew her face off.</b>

1069
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:15,692
<b>But enough of all this bullshit.</b>

1070
01:36:17,027 --> 01:36:18,153
<b>Go to work.</b>

1071
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,364
<b>I have rats in the basement. Go.</b>

1072
01:36:22,908 --> 01:36:24,159
<b>Go.</b>

1073
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:37,339
<b>Well, that was a mistake.</b>

1074
01:36:38,006 --> 01:36:39,091
<b>Was it?</b>

1075
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:42,636
<b>You just sent away the one thing
that would stop me from killing you.</b>

1076
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:45,389
<b>Try, then.</b>

1077
01:36:45,556 --> 01:36:46,765
<b>Do it.</b>

1078
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:53,063
<b>Is the safety on?</b>

1079
01:36:58,151 --> 01:36:59,152
<b>No.</b>

1080
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:04,825
<b>Try your knife.</b>

1081
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:06,785
<b>Ah...</b>

1082
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:14,877
<b>You're in trouble.</b>

1083
01:37:15,043 --> 01:37:16,378
<b>How are you controlling me?</b>

1084
01:37:16,545 --> 01:37:18,589
<b>I'm not controlling you, Natasha.</b>

1085
01:37:19,256 --> 01:37:20,632
<b>Well, not yet.</b>

1086
01:37:21,258 --> 01:37:23,427
<b>But there is a pheromonal lock.</b>

1087
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,182
<b>Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.</b>

1088
01:37:32,728 --> 01:37:35,397
<b>I'm very upset with Melina.</b>

1089
01:37:35,564 --> 01:37:37,441
<b>It's a shame I have to kill her.</b>

1090
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:39,848
<b>Come on, now.
If we're just going to</b>

1091
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,695
<b>press buttons and hack computers...</b>

1092
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:42,934
<b>- Yes.
- I mean, I don't know.</b>

1093
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:44,060
<b>There's nothing for me to do.</b>

1094
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:46,867
<b>I want to...
I want to break something.</b>

1095
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:47,951
<b>Oh, you do?</b>

1096
01:37:49,703 --> 01:37:52,331
<b>Oh, there is something you can break.</b>

1097
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:09,932
<b>Melina, if this is
the last time that we...</b>

1098
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:13,769
<b>Ah, damn it.</b>

1099
01:38:26,615 --> 01:38:28,575
<b>That was disgusting.</b>

1100
01:38:41,964 --> 01:38:43,131
<b>Okay.</b>

1101
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:07,656
<b>So, this was the big plan, huh?</b>

1102
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:12,870
<b>Melina was going to land the Red Room
and hand me over to the authorities.</b>

1103
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:17,708
<b>Oh, no, no, no.</b>

1104
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:26,550
<b>So, what now, you're gonna fold me into
your pathetic little puppeteer act?</b>

1105
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:27,718
<b>Pathetic, huh?</b>

1106
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:29,553
<b>Yeah, what would you call it?</b>

1107
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:30,959
<b>- I would call it...
- When was the last time</b>

1108
01:39:30,971 --> 01:39:32,419
<b>that you had a conversation with somebody</b>

1109
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:34,266
<b>that wasn't forced to talk to you?</b>

1110
01:39:34,433 --> 01:39:37,394
<b>You ran away to fight in the wrong war.</b>

1111
01:39:37,811 --> 01:39:41,315
<b>The real war was fought here,
in the shadows.</b>

1112
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:43,066
<b>You didn't fight in the shadows.</b>

1113
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:44,443
<b>You hid in the dark.</b>

1114
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:48,405
<b>Real power comes
from undetectable influence.</b>

1115
01:39:48,572 --> 01:39:50,991
<b>If no one's noticed, then why even do it?</b>

1116
01:39:51,325 --> 01:39:52,492
<b>You're nothing.</b>

1117
01:39:52,576 --> 01:39:54,786
<b>- Hmm.
- You have nothing.</b>

1118
01:39:55,287 --> 01:39:56,872
<b>There are 50 people on this planet...</b>

1119
01:39:57,039 --> 01:39:58,290
<b>Oh, stop it.</b>

1120
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:01,084
<b>Don't tell me to stop!</b>

1121
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:04,171
<b>If I don't tell you when to stop,
then how will you know when to shut up?</b>

1122
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:09,259
<b>Come on.</b>

1123
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:11,261
<b>Think I can't take a punch?</b>

1124
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:12,429
<b>Oh.</b>

1125
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:17,434
<b>- God damn it, you're weak.
- Weak?</b>

1126
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:19,925
<b>I bet it's easier to be tough
in front of defenseless little girls, huh?</b>

1127
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:21,563
<b>That's enough.</b>

1128
01:40:31,657 --> 01:40:33,283
<b>You wouldn't be so glib</b>

1129
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:37,120
<b>if you had any notion
of the scope of what I've built.</b>

1130
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:41,333
<b>I own this world. Me.</b>

1131
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,252
<b>You seem desperate to impress me.</b>

1132
01:40:43,418 --> 01:40:44,753
<b>I don't need to impress you.</b>

1133
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,422
<b>I don't need to impress anyone.</b>

1134
01:40:48,632 --> 01:40:51,802
<b>These world leaders, these great men,</b>

1135
01:40:52,636 --> 01:40:55,472
<b>they answer to me and my widows.</b>

1136
01:40:59,226 --> 01:41:00,310
<b>Look at them.</b>

1137
01:41:03,105 --> 01:41:04,815
<b>These girls were trash.</b>

1138
01:41:05,941 --> 01:41:08,026
<b>They are thrown out into the street.</b>

1139
01:41:08,485 --> 01:41:11,780
<b>I recycle the trash.</b>

1140
01:41:11,947 --> 01:41:13,824
<b>And I give them purpose.</b>

1141
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:17,452
<b>I give them a life.</b>

1142
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:26,920
<b>Melina, I found the location of the vials.</b>

1143
01:41:28,297 --> 01:41:30,299
<b>I've had a slight setback.</b>

1144
01:41:32,384 --> 01:41:34,094
<b>You'll need to get to the widows.</b>

1145
01:41:53,363 --> 01:41:55,199
<b>It's my network of widows</b>

1146
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:58,410
<b>that help me control the scales of power.</b>

1147
01:41:58,744 --> 01:42:02,831
<b>One command,
the oil and stock markets crumble.</b>

1148
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:07,085
<b>One command,
and a quarter of the planet will starve.</b>

1149
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:10,380
<b>My widows can start and end wars.</b>

1150
01:42:10,631 --> 01:42:13,342
<b>They can make and break kings.</b>

1151
01:42:17,346 --> 01:42:19,890
<b>You control all of that from here?</b>

1152
01:42:20,641 --> 01:42:22,518
<b>And with you,</b>

1153
01:42:23,185 --> 01:42:26,230
<b>an Avenger under my control,</b>

1154
01:42:27,606 --> 01:42:30,067
<b>I can finally come out of the shadows</b>

1155
01:42:31,193 --> 01:42:35,948
<b>using the only natural resource
that the world has too much of.</b>

1156
01:42:37,533 --> 01:42:38,909
<b>Girls.</b>

1157
01:42:49,211 --> 01:42:51,588
<b>All from that little console?</b>

1158
01:42:52,339 --> 01:42:53,549
<b>Yeah.</b>

1159
01:42:57,886 --> 01:42:59,638
<b>Oh, you find this amusing?</b>

1160
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,473
<b>Why are you smiling?</b>

1161
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:04,184
<b>Don't take it personal, but, uh...</b>

1162
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:08,564
<b>Thank you for your cooperation.</b>

1163
01:43:09,022 --> 01:43:13,235
<b>Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,</b>

1164
01:43:13,485 --> 01:43:15,946
<b>you won't be able to take it from him.</b>

1165
01:43:16,113 --> 01:43:19,491
<b>For years, Dreykov has implemented
a pheromonal lock</b>

1166
01:43:19,658 --> 01:43:21,493
<b>in all widows, even me.</b>

1167
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,248
<b>So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.</b>

1168
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:28,041
<b>Well, I'll just hold my breath.</b>

1169
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:29,668
<b>Not enough.</b>

1170
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:31,545
<b>This is basic science.</b>

1171
01:43:31,712 --> 01:43:34,965
<b>Natasha, to block receptors
in olfactory center,</b>

1172
01:43:35,132 --> 01:43:37,176
<b>you have to sever the nerve.</b>

1173
01:43:39,011 --> 01:43:40,345
<b>I can handle that.</b>

1174
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:43,640
<b>You weren't quite strong enough, so...</b>

1175
01:43:44,516 --> 01:43:46,268
<b>I'll have to finish it myself.</b>

1176
01:43:46,351 --> 01:43:48,395
<b>What are you going to do?</b>

1177
01:43:50,355 --> 01:43:51,648
<b>Sever the nerve.</b>

1178
01:44:15,047 --> 01:44:16,465
<b>Melina!</b>

1179
01:44:27,809 --> 01:44:29,489
<b>Precisely what I was thinking.</b>

1180
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:43,867
<b>Yelena, slight change of plan.</b>

1181
01:44:44,034 --> 01:44:47,354
<b>I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.</b>

1182
01:44:50,374 --> 01:44:51,375
<b>Fantastic.</b>

1183
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,043
<b>I'm heading to the widows now.</b>

1184
01:44:54,253 --> 01:44:55,546
<b>No.</b>

1185
01:45:33,166 --> 01:45:34,751
<b>We have to go.</b>

1186
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:42,718
<b>Not so talkative now, are you?</b>

1187
01:45:44,386 --> 01:45:45,470
<b>You took my childhood.</b>

1188
01:45:47,097 --> 01:45:49,641
<b>You took my choices and tried to break me.</b>

1189
01:45:49,808 --> 01:45:51,888
<b>But you're never gonna do that
to anybody ever again.</b>

1190
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,867
<b>Nobody leaves
this room until she's dead.</b>

1191
01:46:07,034 --> 01:46:09,203
<b>Make her suffer.</b>

1192
01:46:11,413 --> 01:46:12,831
<b>I don't wanna hurt you.</b>

1193
01:46:13,415 --> 01:46:14,833
<b>You don't wanna hurt me.</b>

1194
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:10,073
<b>Hey.</b>

1195
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:11,769
<b>Are you okay?</b>

1196
01:48:12,743 --> 01:48:13,869
<b>That looks like it hurts.</b>

1197
01:48:14,036 --> 01:48:16,246
<b>Okay. I take out on 3, ready?</b>

1198
01:48:16,455 --> 01:48:18,415
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

1199
01:48:24,004 --> 01:48:26,364
<b>Get as far away
from here as possible.</b>

1200
01:48:27,132 --> 01:48:28,717
<b>You get to make your own choices now.</b>

1201
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:40,979
<b>We gotta get outta here.</b>

1202
01:48:41,146 --> 01:48:42,302
<b>We need to find Dreykov.
Are you coming?</b>

1203
01:48:42,314 --> 01:48:43,524
<b>I'm right behind you.</b>

1204
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,534
<b>Wait, wait! I have to go back!</b>

1205
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,825
<b>Yes!</b>

1206
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:33,509
<b>Do you see the girls?</b>

1207
01:50:36,386 --> 01:50:37,387
<b>No!</b>

1208
01:51:10,254 --> 01:51:11,839
<b>We need to go back.</b>

1209
01:51:39,157 --> 01:51:40,784
<b>We've lost control.</b>

1210
01:52:04,892 --> 01:52:06,310
<b>Antonia.</b>

1211
01:52:09,188 --> 01:52:11,315
<b>No!</b>

1212
01:52:12,608 --> 01:52:14,318
<b>I'm gonna open the door.</b>

1213
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:16,945
<b>You're gonna come after me.</b>

1214
01:52:17,112 --> 01:52:19,323
<b>It's okay. It's okay.</b>

1215
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,619
<b>I know you're still in there.</b>

1216
01:52:25,537 --> 01:52:28,457
<b>And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.</b>

1217
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:43,866
<b>Yelena!</b>

1218
01:53:45,409 --> 01:53:46,910
<b>She's on the wing!</b>

1219
01:53:47,077 --> 01:53:49,454
<b>Move! What are you waiting for?</b>

1220
01:53:50,998 --> 01:53:51,999
<b>Don't do it!</b>

1221
01:53:52,958 --> 01:53:54,626
<b>This was fun!</b>

1222
01:53:54,793 --> 01:53:55,836
<b>No!</b>

1223
01:55:43,986 --> 01:55:45,320
<b>Okay.</b>

1224
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:48,031
<b>Let's go.</b>

1225
01:56:02,838 --> 01:56:04,089
<b>Enough.</b>

1226
01:56:55,474 --> 01:56:56,892
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

1227
01:56:57,059 --> 01:56:58,477
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

1228
01:57:01,688 --> 01:57:03,273
<b>Is he gone?</b>

1229
01:57:07,694 --> 01:57:09,071
<b>He's gone.</b>

1230
01:57:26,713 --> 01:57:28,090
<b>Yelena!</b>

1231
01:57:38,934 --> 01:57:40,227
<b>Yelena?</b>

1232
01:57:46,942 --> 01:57:49,152
<b>We're both upside down.</b>

1233
01:58:04,168 --> 01:58:05,615
<b>I should've come back for you.</b>

1234
01:58:05,627 --> 01:58:06,795
<b>You don't have to say that.</b>

1235
01:58:06,879 --> 01:58:08,172
<b>- It's okay.
- Hey. Hey.</b>

1236
01:58:08,714 --> 01:58:10,299
<b>It was real to me, too.</b>

1237
01:58:24,563 --> 01:58:25,564
<b>Thank you.</b>

1238
01:58:40,662 --> 01:58:41,788
<b>Everybody good?</b>

1239
01:58:41,955 --> 01:58:44,374
<b>I am clearly injured.</b>

1240
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:47,711
<b>You got something to say?</b>

1241
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:50,088
<b>I'd just mess it up.</b>

1242
01:59:04,436 --> 01:59:06,355
<b>Here comes the cavalry.</b>

1243
01:59:09,358 --> 01:59:11,777
<b>We're closing in on the target, sir.</b>

1244
01:59:14,488 --> 01:59:16,448
<b>So, what's our plan?</b>

1245
01:59:17,366 --> 01:59:19,952
<b>You guys go. I'll stay.</b>

1246
01:59:20,118 --> 01:59:22,079
<b>That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.</b>

1247
01:59:22,162 --> 01:59:24,110
<b>- I'll hold them off.
- Natasha, we fight.</b>

1248
01:59:24,122 --> 01:59:25,820
<b>We can't split up.
You're so pigheaded.</b>

1249
01:59:25,832 --> 01:59:28,001
<b>- You guys, go.
- Oh, my God.</b>

1250
01:59:28,168 --> 01:59:30,921
<b>Besides, if it can work out
with the 4 of us, you know,</b>

1251
01:59:31,088 --> 01:59:33,507
<b>there may be some hope for the Avengers.</b>

1252
01:59:33,674 --> 01:59:34,967
<b>Little bit.</b>

1253
01:59:35,133 --> 01:59:39,054
<b>Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.</b>

1254
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:41,765
<b>I know how much you like it.</b>

1255
01:59:41,932 --> 01:59:43,725
<b>Shucks.</b>

1256
01:59:43,809 --> 01:59:45,060
<b>It does have a lot of pockets.</b>

1257
01:59:45,227 --> 01:59:47,229
<b>Very handy pockets, yeah.</b>

1258
01:59:48,355 --> 01:59:50,524
<b>He had widows implanted
all over the world.</b>

1259
01:59:50,691 --> 01:59:52,568
<b>Melina will need to copy the formula,</b>

1260
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:54,990
<b>but you should be the one
to tell 'em it's over.</b>

1261
02:00:14,756 --> 02:00:16,675
<b>You came back for us.</b>

1262
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:26,810
<b>Thank you.</b>

1263
02:00:31,857 --> 02:00:33,108
<b>Hey.</b>

1264
02:00:33,775 --> 02:00:36,570
<b>Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?</b>

1265
02:00:36,737 --> 02:00:37,863
<b>Don't worry. I got this.</b>

1266
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:39,489
<b>I know.</b>

1267
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:52,794
<b>Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.</b>

1268
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:55,797
<b>Come. Come with us.</b>

1269
02:02:30,475 --> 02:02:31,602
<b>You ever not sleep?</b>

1270
02:02:32,769 --> 02:02:36,148
<b>I've been in 6 different time zones
in 3 days because of you.</b>

1271
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:37,608
<b>- Oh, really?
- Yeah.</b>

1272
02:02:37,774 --> 02:02:40,235
<b>What, are you scrapping together
some parts?</b>

1273
02:02:40,402 --> 02:02:43,947
<b>What'd you get me this time,
like, an upside-down lawnmower?</b>

1274
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:51,413
<b>You see what I can get you
with a bit of time and money?</b>

1275
02:02:57,419 --> 02:02:59,046
<b>Go on, say it.
I wanna hear it.</b>

1276
02:02:59,213 --> 02:03:01,840
<b>It would really be good for me
to hear it. Really.</b>

1277
02:03:03,091 --> 02:03:04,259
<b>I'm impressed.</b>

1278
02:03:04,426 --> 02:03:06,094
<b>Well, yeah.</b>

1279
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:09,348
<b>You've always been
a really good friend to me.</b>

1280
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:12,017
<b>That's what every man wants to hear.</b>

1281
02:03:12,809 --> 02:03:13,977
<b>Where you gonna go?</b>

1282
02:03:15,312 --> 02:03:17,981
<b>It's funny. My whole life,
I didn't think I had any family.</b>

1283
02:03:18,148 --> 02:03:20,317
<b>Turns out I got two, so...</b>

1284
02:03:20,817 --> 02:03:22,265
<b>One of them's a bit of a mess right now.</b>

1285
02:03:22,277 --> 02:03:25,072
<b>I'm gonna go break
a few of them out of prison</b>

1286
02:03:25,572 --> 02:03:28,075
<b>see if I can't help patch things up.</b>

1287
02:11:14,917 --> 02:11:17,252
<b>Come on, Fanny.</b>

1288
02:12:35,998 --> 02:12:38,500
<b>Wow. Sorry.</b>

1289
02:12:39,585 --> 02:12:41,920
<b>I'm allergic to the Midwest.</b>

1290
02:12:44,423 --> 02:12:47,259
<b>What this woman did,</b>

1291
02:12:47,426 --> 02:12:50,262
<b>honestly, I can't even imagine.</b>

1292
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:54,516
<b>You're not supposed to be bothering me
on my holiday time, Valentina.</b>

1293
02:12:54,683 --> 02:12:56,185
<b>Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no.</b>

1294
02:12:56,268 --> 02:12:58,812
<b>I'm just here paying my respects.</b>

1295
02:12:58,896 --> 02:12:59,980
<b>Hmm...</b>

1296
02:13:00,397 --> 02:13:02,691
<b>You know, coming here
makes you look desperate.</b>

1297
02:13:06,028 --> 02:13:07,070
<b>Okay.</b>

1298
02:13:07,237 --> 02:13:08,322
<b>I want a raise.</b>

1299
02:13:08,488 --> 02:13:09,823
<b>Oh, yeah. You and me both.</b>

1300
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:12,451
<b>Believe me, you're gonna earn it.</b>

1301
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:15,913
<b>I've got your next target.</b>

1302
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:17,831
<b>Thought I'd hand-deliver it.</b>

1303
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:24,880
<b>Maybe you'd like a shot at the man
responsible for your sister's death.</b>

1304
02:13:27,633 --> 02:13:29,593
<b>Kind of a cutie, don't you think?</b>
